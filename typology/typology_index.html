            <h2>Typology Introduction</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>It is usually an Old Testament type prefiguring something about redemption in the New Testament. The
                    sacrificial system, the feasts and the whole sanctuary system were designed to foretell the sacrificial,
                    redemptive work of Christ. In this sense, a type, by definition, points to the future of Christ, the
                    church or the world to come.
                </p>
                    <h2>Forgotten Bible Study Method</h2>
                    <p>Typology seems to be largely neglected in the modern church mainly due to The laws and restrictions of the
                            Old Testament.
                            People are so involved with the object of the Gospel that they have forgotten the shadow for the object.
                            They  reject the laws as if they were not given by the same God they worship in the New Testament. They cry
                            "grace" as if the Lord acquired it later and it was never His trait in the Old Testament. The
                            consequence is they miss out on the unfulfilled truths in the Old Testament stories, laws, and
                            covenants.
                        </p>
                            
                    <h2>The justification and scriptures for typology</h2>
                    <h3>Jesus and Typology</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <h3><ol>The walk to Emmaus</ol></h3>
                             </ul>
        
                    
                            <p><strong>The advice to the Pharisees</strong> (John 5:39–44): Jesus told the Pharisees who happened not to
                                    understand the types/shadows about Him in the Old Testament that they should search the Scriptures, and
                                    they would find Him.</p>
                    
                            <p><strong>The bronze snake</strong>: As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man
                                    be lifted up (John 3:14; cf. Numbers 21:9).</p>
                            <ul>
                                    <h3><ol>Hebrews and Typology</ol></h3>
                            </ul>
                    
                            <p>For the law having <strong><em>a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the
                                                    things</em></strong>, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year
                                    continually make the comers thereunto perfect (Hebrews 10:1 KJV, emphasis added).</p>
                    
                            <p>Who serve unto <strong><em>the example and shadow of heavenly things</em></strong>, as Moses was admonished
                                    of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith He, <em>that</em> thou make all things
                                    according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount (Hebrews 8:5 KJV).</p>
                    
                            <p>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the
                                    first tabernacle was yet standing: <strong><em>Which was a figure for the time then
                                                    present</em></strong>, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not
                                    make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience (Hebrews 9:8-9 KJV).</p>
                    <br>

                            <h3>Paul and Typology</h3>
                            <p><em>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday, or of the new moon, or
                                            of the Sabbath days: <strong>Which are a shadow of things to come; but</strong> the body is of
                                            Christ (Colossians 2:16-17 KJV).</em></p>
                    
                            <p><em>Now all these things happened <strong>unto them for ensamples</strong>: and they are written for our
                                            admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come (1 Corinthians 10:11 KJV).</em></p>
                    
                            <p>By declaring "the substance belongs to Christ," Paul is basically teaching that all the sanctuary
                                    terminology, laws, ceremonial requirements point forward to the reality of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
                                    ultimate fulfiller of the law to the smallest tittle.</p>
                    
                            <p><em>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even
                                            <strong>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us (1 Corinthians 5:7 KJV).</em></p>
                    
                            <br>
                            <h3>Matthew and the Exodus</strong></h3>
                            <p>The writer of the book of Matthew shows it follows after the Old Testament exodus story. Baptism, wilderness,
                                    temptations sequence is common to both the Israelites and Jesus.</p>

                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    Just as a shadow follows the outlines and shape of the object, the type and antitype must have a similar flow of events or similarities in the area they are both depicting or demonstrating. 
                    Example: the type Passover lamb and antitype Christ were both blameless/innocent and substitutes for sin that is not theirs. Also, evil cannot be the type of what is good and pure.
                </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dual Historicity:</strong></li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    The types and antitypes both take place. In most cases, the type has a literal
                     meaning at its point in time that is important. The antitype is just a secondary 
                     meaning that God has hidden in time and space about the event referring to the letter coming of His son.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Note: Allegory is dangerous and it is where some interpreters claim that the types 
                    (Old Testament stories) didn’t happen and they are just symbolic stories (with no 
                    historical happening) written to predict the coming of Messiah. Hence they are just
                     vessels with hidden spiritual meanings. In summary, it promotes single historicity antitype/fulfillment.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The allegory minimizes and often destroys the literal and historical in favor of the secondary sense.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type is More Glorious than Object</strong></li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    The antitype is more perfect, greater, and continues. It reveals more truth when
                     fulfilled and is more superior to the type. Christ can save; the blood of lambs and 
                     goats can't. Christ is superior to Melchizedek. Christ's redemptive work is greater than 
                     that of the Passover.
                </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Predictiveness/Predictive Prophecy</strong></li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    Because of the correspondence or similar flow of events, if one knows the flow of the antitype, 
                    they can predict the flow of the antitype. Simply said, if the Jews had understood the Jewish 
                    sanctuary and sacrificial system, they would have understood the purpose and mission of the Messiah.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    In a sense, the prophets knew about the antitype or future fulfillment.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The prophets studied carefully and tried to learn about this salvation. They spoke about 
                    the grace that was coming to you. (1 Peter 1:10 ERV)
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The Spirit of Christ was in those prophets. And the Spirit was telling about the sufferings 
                    that would happen to Christ and about the glory that would come after those sufferings. 
                    The prophets tried to learn about what the Spirit was showing them—when it would happen and what 
                    the world would be like at that time. (1 Peter 1:11 ERV)
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    It was made clear to them that their service was not for themselves. They were serving you when 
                    they told about the things you have now heard. You heard them from those who told you the Good News 
                    with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even the angels would like very much to know more
                     about these things you were told. (1 Peter 1:12 ERV)
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    These rules may be safely followed: wherever the three characteristics of types are found which have 
                    been already mentioned, there is the type.

            <h1>THE DANGERS OF TYPOLOGY</h1>
            <div class="card-container">
             
                <h3>How Much of the Old Testament Is Typical?</strong></h3>
                
                <h3>The extravagance of some of the early Fathers (Idealism)/false
         typology</strong></h3>
                
                <p>The early Fathers,
         as Origen, Ambrose, and Jerome (revived in our time by Andrew Jukes and his
         imitators). They sought for types, and of course found them, in
         every incident and event, however trivial, recorded in Scripture.</p>
                
                <p>Mystery and mysticism were seen everywhere, in the cords and
         pins of the tabernacle, in the yield of herds, in the death of one, in the
         marriage of another, even in the number of fish caught by the disciples on the
         night the risen Saviour appeared to them--how much some have tried to make of
         that number, 153!</p>
                
                <h3>The rejection of
         typology as a method of interpretation</strong></h3>
         
                <p>This opinion assumes that the <strong><em>New Testament writers have
         exhausted the types of the Old Testamen</em></strong>t, while the fact is that those
         found in the later Scripture are but samples taken from the storehouse where
         many more are found. If they are not, then nothing is more arbitrary than the
         New Testament use of types, for there is nothing to distinguish them from a
         multitude of others of the same class. </p>
                
                <p>Further, the view assumes that divine authority alone can
         determine the reality and import of types--a view that applies with equal force
         against prophecy. The idea that God can not inspire people to discern truth not
         openly stated in the Bible</p>

            <h2>Classification of Typology</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p><strong>Personal types</strong>, these are person in 
                    Scripture whose lives and experiences illustrate some principle or 
                    truth of redemption. These include Adam, who is expressly described 
                    as the "figure of him that was to come" (Rom 5:14), Melchizedek, Abraham, 
                    Aaron,Joseph, Jonah, etc.</p>
                
                <p> <strong>Historical /Event types</strong>, these include historical events 
                    in the Old Testament that have  striking correspondence and are shadows e.g.
                    the Exodus the Call of Abraham; Deliverances by the Judges, etc. </p>
                
                <p> <strong>Ritual types,</strong>these include the sanctuary and sacrificial 
                    system in the Old Testament such as the Altar, the High Priest, the Priesthood, 
                    the Tabernacle and its furniture. </p>
