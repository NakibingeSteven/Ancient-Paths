  <h1>Left Behind or Taken</h1>
  <p><em>“Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the
      other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the
      other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming”
      (Matthew 24:40-42).</em></p>

  <p>This is the second most quoted
    Scripture in the Bible used to support the doctrine of an invisible return of
    Jesus Christ and vanishing Christians. Supposedly, “one will be taken and the
    other left” means believers will disappear in an unperceived flash, while the
    rest of the world suddenly wakes up in mystified ignorance wondering, which way
    did they go<strong></strong></p>

  <p><strong>Historicists </strong>teach that the righteous are <strong>taken to heaven </strong>by Jesus
    at the <strong>second coming </strong>and futurists say that it occurs at the <strong>rapture
      seven years before </strong>the second coming.<strong> </strong><strong>There are texts </strong>in Scripture
    that teach that Jesus <strong>will
      take </strong>His people to heaven and leave the wicked behind at His coming.
    However, the question is whether <strong>these specific verses teach the RAPTURE.</strong></p>

  <p>These verses do not say: “One will be taken with Jesus <strong>to
      heaven </strong>and the other will be left behind <strong>on earth</strong>.”</p>

  <p><strong>Context
      of Matthew 24</strong></p>

  <p>Matthew 24 begins with our Savior quietly
    sitting upon the Mount of Olives. His “disciples came to Him privately, saying,
    <em>'Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your
      coming, and of the end of the age?'' ” (Matthew 24:3</em>)
  </p>

  <p>Obviously, the disciples were
    thinking about Jesus' return and the end of the world. Because of mental gaps
    and some loose ends, they asked the Master to clarify the truth.</p>

  <p>Christ's very first words were<em>,
      “Take heed that no one deceives you”</em> (Matthew 24:4). It clearly implies that when it comes to this exact
    topic of
    His “coming” or “Parousia,” Jesus knew there was going to be a great deal of
    deception whirling around.</p>

  <p>Our
    Lord continued, “<em>For false christs and
      false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if
      possible, even the elect”</em> (Matthew 24:24). Here Jesus said Satan's
    delusions will eventually become so subtle and powerful that only “the elect”
    will come through unscathed</p>

  <p>Immediately
    after warning about tricky false prophets and deception, Jesus said, “Wherefore
    if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold,
    he is in the <em>secret </em>chambers; believe it not. <em>For
      as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shines even unto the west; so
      shall also the coming of the Son of man be” (Matthew 24:26-27 </em><em>KJV</em><em>, emphasis added).</em></p>

  <p>Here
    Jesus draws a<strong> razor-sharp contrast
      between false views of His return and the truth.</strong> Don't miss that little
    word, “secret” (verse 26). Jesus plainly warned that some will mistakenly
    promote a <strong>“secret”</strong> coming. Based on
    the context, we discover that this will be one of those powerful delusions
    which only God's faithful elect will avoid</p>

  <p>Jesus
    Himself compares His return to the brilliant flashing of electrically-charged
    bolts of lightning hurtling across the sky.</p>

  <p><strong>Use
      of Parousia</strong></p>
  <p>Jesus uses the Greek word “Parousia” for “coming” in verse 27 and verse 3 of
    Matthew</p>

  <p>Disciples question<strong>:</strong> <em>And as he sat upon the mount of
      Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall
      these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy <strong>coming</strong>,(parousia used) and of the end of the
      world? (Mat 24:3 KJV,
      emphasis added)</em></p>


  <p>Christ answered: <em>For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also
      the coming (<strong>parousia)</strong> of the Son of man be.(Mat 24:27 KJV. Emphasis added)</em></p>
  <p>This
    is clear evidence that the Parousia definitely applies to the highly visible
    second coming of Jesus Christ. After warning about
    secretive delusions, Jesus finally answered their exact question by lifting the
    curtain of history and fully unveiling what His cataclysmic return would be
    like:</p>

  <p><em>And then
      shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall <strong>all the tribes of the earth mourn, and
        they
        shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great
        glory</strong>. And he shall <strong>send his angels
        with a great sound of a trumpet</strong>, and <strong>they
        shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to
        the other</strong>.(Mat 24:30-31 KJV</em><em>, emphasis added</em><em>)</em></p>

  <p>Masses
    of humanity will literally “<em>see </em>the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
    great glory.” Certainly no one will miss it, and no one will wake up the next
    day wondering, <em>Which way</em> <em>did the Christians go?</em></p>

  <p>This
    entire passage also parallels Paul's words in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. Just
    like in Paul's description of what will happen when true believers are “caught
    up,” Jesus Christ also said His coming would be a very noisy event that will
    include loud reverberations from “a great sound of a trumpet” throughout the
    sky. When that booming blast is heard, multitudes of shining angels will
    descend into Earth’s polluted atmosphere, circle the globe, and “<em>gather together</em> His elect from the four
    winds, from one end of heaven to the
    other.” Thus true believers will be “caught up” into the air. Now don't miss
    it. These are the very same elements Paul wrote about in 1 Thessalonians 4:17!</p>

  <p>In
    both Matthew 24:30-31, and in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, <strong>we read about clouds, noise, a loud trumpet, a
      gathering together, and
      true believers being transported into the sky</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The
      example of Noah</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Sudden not secret</strong></p>

  <p><strong><em>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven</em></strong><em>, but my
      Father only. But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming</em><em>(<strong>parousia)</strong></em><em>
      of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were
      before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
      marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, And knew not until the
      flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming(<strong>parousia</strong>)of the Son of man be.
      Then
      shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill;
      the one shall be taken, and the other left. Watch therefore: for ye know not
      what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house
      had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would
      not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in
      such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</em><em> </em><em>(Mat 24:36-44 KJV)</em></p>

  <p>The
    ancient people thought Noah was a crazy old man, until “the flood came and took
    them all away, so also will the <em>coming
    </em>of the Son of Man be” (Matthew 24:39, emphasis added).</p>

  <p>Immediately after Jesus described His
    “Parousia” or second coming in verse 39, He continued without skipping a beat:
    “THEN two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left”
    (verse 40, emphasis added).</p>

  <p>Immediately
    after saying, “One will be taken and the other left,” the King of kings then
    compared His second coming to the sudden arrival of a midnight thief, just like
    Paul did in 1 Thessalonians 5:2-3. Jesus Christ said, “But know this, that if
    the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have
    watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be
    ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect” (Matthew
    24:43-44).</p>

  <p>Jesus
    basically said, “It will be just like Noah's day” (see verses 37-39). Did Noah and his family vanish before the
    flood? No, </p>

  <h2>The Important Flood Context</h2>
  <p>The <strong>immediate context </strong>of verses <strong>41, 42 </strong>clearly
    tells us <strong>when </strong>one is taken and the other is left. Jesus then teaches
    that the end time taken-left passage is parallel to when Noah <strong>entered </strong>the
    ark, the <strong>door closed </strong>and <strong>destruction </strong>came.</p>

  <p>In the <strong>days of Noah</strong>, they <strong>entered </strong>the ark, the
    <strong>door closed</strong>, seven days passed and then <strong>destruction </strong>for the
    wicked came. Moreover, Jesus emphasized that <strong>His Parousia </strong>would follow
    this <strong>same pattern</strong>. The flood story provides the <strong>historical parallel </strong>for
    those who are 'taken' and those who are 'left'. We should direct our attention
    to the destiny of the wicked and the righteous before Jesus comes on the clouds
    of heaven.
  </p>

  <p>The nature of the flood</p>
  <p>The flood was <strong>no secret event</strong>. It took everyone away
    except Noah and his family. The flood was a <strong>global catastrophe </strong>that
    wiped out <strong>everyone outside </strong>the ark</p>

  <p>The Important Sodom and Gomorrah Context</p>
  <p><em>“Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they
      drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 29 but on the day that
      Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and <strong>destroyed
      </strong>them <strong>all</strong>. 30 <strong>Even so [in the same way] </strong>will it be in the day
      when the Son of Man is revealed</em><strong> Luke 17:29</strong></p>

  <p>There were <strong>not three groups </strong>in Lot's day. Who were
    the <strong>only ones left </strong>after God destroyed the cities? The saved were the <strong>only
      ones left</strong>!</p>

    the taken and left</h2>

  <p>A brief comparison of both the Noah-Noah and the Noah-Sodom
    analogies given by Jesus about his second coming(<em>claimed rapture in this verse</em>) in both the Mathew
    and Luke account shows that the words
    left and destroyed refer to those who are not taken at the Lords second
    coming/rapture of the church. They remain on earth and are destroyed</p>

  <h2>The two groups of the bible and
    the three groups of the rapture</h2>
  <p>When the flood came there were <strong>just two groups</strong>, the

  <h2>In summary</strong></h2>
  <p>Believers
    will be “taken” (verse 40) at the “coming,” or “Parousia” (verse 39), which the
    Bible clearly applies to the loud, visible, and glorious appearance of Jesus
    Christ at the very end of the world (see Matthew 24:3, 27, 30-31, 39).</p>
