  <h1>Left or Taken</h1>
  <p>The most quoted passage used to support the rapture
    concept is 1 Thessalonians 4:17. There Paul wrote that true believers will someday be
    “caught up… in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17). <strong>But does “caught up”
      mean disappear?</strong> </p>

  <p>Is Paul describing a silent return of Jesus Christ?
    The answer is in the
    context We must slow down and take a closer look at the full context of the
    statements made by Paul look.</p>

  <p><em>For the Lord Himself will
      descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the
      trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive
      and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
      in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians
      4:16-17).</em></p>

  <p>Rapture teachers interpret this
    event as silent and secret, yet doesn't it seem rather loud and visible? There
    is a shout, a voice, a trumpet. The truth is, 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is one of
    the noisiest verses in the Bible due to the following </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jesus
      Christ comes down from Heaven shouting and blowing a trumpet.</li>
    <li>The
      dead rise from graves</li>
    <li>Then
      true believers are “caught up.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>An example of Jesus</h2>
  <p>Two thousand years ago, at the
    end of His earthly life, Jesus Christ was also “taken up,” (Acts 1:9). This
    doesn't mean He disappeared, leaving His clothes on earth. Instead, in full
    view of His wondering disciples<em>, “while
      they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight”</em>
    (Acts 1:9, emphasis added).</p>

  <p>This event was highly visible.
    Luke said Jesus Christ was “taken up,” and then clouds are mentioned, just like
    Paul wrote about believers being “caught up…in the clouds.”. Luke goes on to
    explain that Jesus will come back in a similar way</p>

  <p><em>Now
      when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a
      cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward
      heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also
      said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus,
      who was taken up from you into heaven, will <strong>so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into
        heaven”</strong> (Acts
      1:9-11, emphasis added).</em></p>

  <p>Jesus was <strong>literally and visibly “taken up” into the clouds,</strong> even <strong>so would He “come
      in like manner as [they
      had seen] Him go into heaven.</strong> The angels taught no secret coming or
    vanishing Christians. Everything will be highly visible, just like the
    ascension of Jesus Christ.</p>
