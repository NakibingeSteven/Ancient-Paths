    <h1>Judas Antitype</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        This exact phrase, “the son of perdition,” occurs only twice in the
        entire New Testament. One of these is in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 about the
        antichrist:
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >“Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day [the day when
          Jesus Christ returns to gather us] will not come unless the falling
          away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed,
          <strong>the son of perdition</strong>” (2 Thessalonians 2:3).</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The only other time it is used is in John 17:12 when Jesus Christ
        applied it to one of His own disciples, Judas Iscariot, His betrayer:
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those
          that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost,
          <strong>but the son of perdition</strong>; that the scripture might be
          fulfilled. (Joh 17:12 KJV)</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesus referred to Judas Iscariot with the
        <strong>identical name</strong> of the ‘man of sin,’ so the character of
        the ‘man of sin’ must bear a <strong>marked resemblance</strong> to the
        character of Judas.
