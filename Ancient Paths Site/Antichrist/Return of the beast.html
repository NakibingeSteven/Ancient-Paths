  <h1>Return of the Beast</h1>
  <p>Prophecy predicts that the 'man of sin' would have two periods of
    dominion—one in the past and one in the future. The papacy would be freed from
    captivity to the civil power in <strong>538 AD </strong>but would be thrown back into
    captivity by the same power in <strong>1798 AD</strong>. </p>

  <p>Paul did not explain that the 'man of sin' would be <strong>bound </strong>(before
    538 AD) and then <strong>released </strong>(in 538 AD) and <strong>bound again </strong>(in 1798
    AD) only to be <strong>released once more </strong>(by the beast from the earth in the
    near future).this part of the puzzle was added to the prophecy in Revelation 13</p>

  <p>The prophecy of Revelation 13:9, 10, 3 indicates that the papacy will <strong>once
      again be freed </strong>from its captivity</p>
  <p>The Bible warns
    “…<em>his deadly wound was healed: and all
      the world wondered after the beast” (Revelation 13:3 KJV).</em></p>

  <p>This literal
    view of a murdered and resurrected Mr. Sin has been depicted in scores of
    prophecy books. Although details vary, most modern portrayals involve the
    antichrist being shot with a gun and then miraculously being raised to life</p>

  <p><strong>The wound and captivity of the beast</strong></p>
  <p>The wounding of
    the beast is referred to four times in Revelation (13:3, 10, 12, and 14). Yet,
    the beast “was wounded by <em>the sword </em>and lived” (13:14, emphasis added).
    Thus his wound comes from “the sword,” not a pistol, rifle, or submachine gun.</p>

  <p>Revelation
    13:10 also reveals the additional insight that the wounding of the beast
    involves his going “into captivity.”</p>

  <p><strong>Healing the wound</strong></p>
  <p>The prophecies
    about “the little horn” and “the beast” do not stop with the 1,260- year
    period, the deadly “wound by the sword,” or the beast's “captivity.”</p>

  <p>Scripture
    predicts, “…his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the
    beast” (Revelation 13:3 KJV)</p><br>

  <p><strong>Satan and Beast(Revelation 20 parallel)</strong></p>
  <p>The
    <strong>best parallel </strong>to understand the binding and unbinding of the papacy/antichrist
    is found in the book of <strong>Revelation </strong>itself
