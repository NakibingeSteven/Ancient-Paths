    <h1>THE RESTRAINER</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        In the times of the apostle Paul, someone/something was preventing the
        'man of sin' from openly rising to power. So to speak, the 'man of sin'
        was anxious to openly reveal himself but he was restrained or in
        captivity
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2 Thessalonians 2:5-8, Paul wrote that once the restraint was
        removed, antichrist would be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
          things? And now
          <strong
            >ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
            time</strong
          >. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
          letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall
          that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit
          of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming</em
        >: (2Th 2:5-8 KJV)
      </p>
      <p>Note</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Paul previously “told” the Thessalonians what the restrainer was (vs.
          5).
        </li>
        <li>The Thessalonians knew what it was (vs. 6).</li>
        <li>
          For some important reason, Paul did not identify the restrainer in
          writing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Brief answer</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Roman Empire/emperors ruled the world. The man of sin
        <strong>could not occupy the throne </strong>of civil power until the
        Roman <strong>Empire/emperor </strong>were taken out of the way.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Testimony of the early church fathers</strong></p>
      Did the early Christians reveal what they knew about this subject? Did
      they identify the restrainer? The answer, surprisingly, is yes. Such early
      writers as Irenäus, Tertullian, Chrysostom, Jerome, and Augustine all
      wrote about this topic. What did they say? They all said the restrainer
      was <em>the civil power of the</em>
      <em>Roman Empire ruled by the Caesars</em>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Tertullian:<em>
          “…he who now hinders must hinder until he be taken out of the way.
          What obstacle is there but the Roman state; the falling away of which,
          by being scattered into ten kingdoms, shall introduce antichrist”</em

          in different parts perhaps, but all about the same time; and after

        <b>The Testimony of Church Historians </b><br />
        Scores of church historians concur with the view of the early church
        fathers: <br />
        <i
          >“Long ages ago, when Rome through the neglect of the Western emperors
          was left to the mercy of the barbarous hordes, the Romans turned to
          one figure for aid and protection, and asked him to rule them; and
          thus, in this simple manner, the best title of all to kingly right,
          commenced the temporal sovereignty of the popes. And meekly stepping
          to the throne of Caesar, the Vicar of Christ took up the scepter to
          which the emperors and kings of Europe were to bow in reverence
          through so many ages.” </i

        <i
          >“Under the Roman Empire the popes had no temporal powers. But when
          the Roman Empire had disintegrated and its place had been taken by a
          number of rude, barbarous kingdoms, the Roman Catholic Church not only
          became independent of the states in religious affairs but dominated

        <i
          >“During the whole medieval period there was in Rome a single
          spiritual and temporal authority [the papacy] exercising powers which

          Roman emperor.”</i

      <p><strong>Testimony of the prophecy of Revelation</strong></p>
      <p>
        The book of <strong>Revelation </strong>describes this transfer of
        power: The ten-horned dragon
        <strong>gave his throne and authority </strong>to the beast:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >“Now the <strong>beast [symbol of the papacy] </strong>which I saw
          was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his
          mouth like the mouth of a lion. The
          <strong>dragon [pagan Rome] gave him [the papacy] </strong>his
          <strong>power</strong>, his <strong>throne</strong>, and great
          <strong>authority</strong>.”</em
        ><strong> Revelation 13:2</strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Testimony of the prophecies of Daniel</strong></p>
      <p>
        The reason why the early Church believed this may be found in the
        parallel prophecy of Daniel 7. Daniel's prophecy predicted the rise of
        four great beasts representing four successive world empires (see Daniel
        7:23). These four empires are the successive kingdoms of Babylon,
        Medo-Persia,
      </p>
      <p>
        Greece, and Rome. The ten horns are ten kingdoms to arise in Western
        Europe after the demise of the Roman Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel's prophecy distinctly says that <em>“after”</em> the ten horns
        are in place, and then rising up “<em>among them,”</em> would come
        <em>“another little horn”</em> with
        <em
          >“eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things”</em
        >
        (vs. 8 KJV).
      </p>
      <p>
        In simple language,
        <strong
          >after the fourth beast, that is, after the fall of Rome, the
          antichrist would rise up among ten nations in Europe</strong

        The reality of this fierce Roman persecution against the early
        Christians provides a logical explanation as to why Paul only “told” the
        Thessalonians what the restrainer was, rather than writing it down. What
        if his letter fell into the hands of unfriendly Roman officials? What if
        Roman leaders found out that these Christians expected the mighty Roman
        Empire to someday crash, being “taken out of the way”?

        The symbolic nature of the prophesies of the bible is one of the factors
        that has preserved the Bible, just as Jesus and the parables, the people
        of God are given wisdom to understand but the unbelievers do not
        understand hence they see not the truth that condemns the fall of
        empress and the slavation that comes to God.to them it appears
        foolishness and nonsense
      </p>
      <p><strong>Historical fulfillment</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the year <strong>330 AD </strong>Emperor Constantine
        <strong>moved the seat </strong>of the Roman Empire to Constantinople
        thus <strong>weakening the political power </strong>of the Roman
        emperor/empire in the west.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, around the <strong>end of the fourth </strong>and
        <strong>early fifth </strong>centuries, hordes of
        <strong>barbarian tribes </strong>from the north invaded and carved up
        the Roman Empire
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of this <strong>chaotic situation</strong>, the
        <strong>Bishop of Rome </strong>was <strong>enticed </strong>by the
        Barbarian tribes to take the reins of civil power and bring about
        <strong>order </strong>in the empire. As a result, the bishop of Rome
        was not only the <strong>spiritual leader </strong>of the church but
        also became the <strong>temporal ruler </strong>of the state. In this
        way, the Roman Empire <strong>was taken out of the way </strong>to give
        way to the papacy
      </p>
      <p>
        The Roman Catholic, <strong>James P. Conroy </strong>explains it this
        way:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >“Long ages ago, when Rome through the

      <p><strong>The modern view and the rapture</strong></p>
      <p>
        Evangelicals who believe in the Rapture of the church before the
        tribulation and even the Andrews University Study Bible erroneously
        teach that the restrainer is the Holy Spirit who will be removed before
        the tribulation. However if this were true, then why would there be any
        need for Paul to be so cautious?
      </p>
      <p>
        When modern interpreters identify the restrainer as the Holy Spirit
        inside the Christian Church, they are simply expressing a newly
        developed fancy unsupported by historical evidence
      </p>
      <p>
        This new theory has now become one of the supporting pillars beneath the
        idea that the rapture must come before antichrist shows up. But we have
        already proven from 2 Thessalonians 2 that it's really the other way
        around. Paul emphatically said antichrist <em>must come first </em>(vs.
        3) before the Church is gathered to Jesus Christ (vs. 1).

        Thus the antichrist was “already” starting to work in Paul's time, yet
        it was restrained by the mighty power of the Roman Empire. Once this
        restraint was removed by the collapse of the Roman government this
        monstrous evil would fully rise in Europe. In other words, once the
        Caesars went down, antichrist would fully set up his religio-political

        Paul said that after the restrainer was taken out of the way, the
        antichrist would be revealed (see 2 Thessalonians 2:7-8). History
        records that the Roman Empire collapsed in 476 A.D. Did the predicted
        antichrist soon appear?
