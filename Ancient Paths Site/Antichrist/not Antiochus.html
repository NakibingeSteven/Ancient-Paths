    <h1>ANTIOCHUS IS NOT THE LITTLE HORN</h1>
    <section>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>He never attacked Prince of princes</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The little horn was to stand up against the Prince of princes, which
        expression refers, beyond controversy, to Jesus Christ. (Daniel 9: 25;
        Acts 3: 15; Revelation 1: 5.) But Antiochus died one hundred sixty-four
        years before our Lord was born. The prophecy cannot therefore apply to
        him, for he does not fulfill the specifications in a single particular
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The origin of the horn through the horns</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The little horn comes froth from one of the horns of the goat. How, it
        may be asked, can that be true of Rome? Earthly governments are not
        introduced into prophecy until they become in some way connected with
        the people of God. Rome became connected with the Jews, the people of
        God at that time, by the famous Jewish League in 161 BC [7] But seven
        years before this, that is, 168 BC, Rome had conquered Macedonia, and
        made that country a part of its empire. Rome is therefore introduced
        into prophecy just as, from the overthrow of the Macedonian horn of the
        goat, it is going forth to new conquests in other directions. It
        appeared to the prophet as coming forth from of the horns of the goat.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Origin of the little horn through the four winds</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding
        great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant
        land” (Daniel 8: 8, 9). The question arises, when it says that “out of
        one of them” came forth a little horn, what did the “them” refer to—one
        of the “four notable ones,” the four generals who divided Alexander's
        empire (out of which Antiochus came), or was it from one of “the four
        winds of heaven,” that is, simply, one of the compass points of the map?
        The evidence points strongly in favor of the latter, that is, the little
        horn came of out the “four winds of heaven,” which is the immediate
        antecedent of the phrase, “and out of one of them.”
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The areas conquered match Roman conquest</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The little horn waxed great toward the south. This was true of Rome.
        Egypt was made a province of the Roman Empire in 30 BC, and continued
        such for some centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The little horn waxed great toward the east. This also was true of Rome.
        She conquered Syria in 65 BC, and made it a province
      </p>

      <p>
        The little horn waxed great toward the pleasant land. So did Rome. Judea
        is called "the pleasant land" in many scriptures. The Romans made it a
        province of their empire in 63 BC, and eventually destroyed the city and
        the temple, and scattered the Jews throughout the earth.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Did not crucify the lord</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The little horn "magnified himself even to the Prince of the host." Rome
        alone did this. In the interpretation (verse 25) the little horn is said
        to "stand up against the Prince of princes." This is clearly an allusion
        to the crucifixion of our Lord under the jurisdiction of the Romans.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The lineup of bible kingdoms</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The field of vision here is substantially the same as that covered by
        Nebuchadnezzar's image of Daniel 2, and the vision of Daniel 7. In both
        these prophetic delineations we have found that the power which
        succeeded Greece as the fourth great power was Rome. The only natural
        inference would be that the little horn, the power which in this vision
        succeeds Greece as an "exceeding great" kingdom, is also Rome.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Antiochus was a Seleucid king</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Antiochus was from one of the fur dynasties that came from Alexander the
        great so he was one of the four horns since horns symbolize kings or
        kingdoms. If his successors and predecessors were part of the four horns
        why set him apart from him
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparative greatness of the kingdoms</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The little horn of the goat was to wax exceeding great compared to the
        powers before it; but Antiochus Epiphanes did not become exceeding
        great. On the contrary, he did not enlarge his dominion, except by some
        temporary conquests in Egypt. The Persian ram “magnified himself” (8:4);
        the Grecian goat “magnified himself exceedingly” (8:8).
      </p>

      <p>
        The little horn magnified itself “exceedingly “in different directions.
        On the horizontal level it “grew exceedingly great” toward the south,
        east, and glorious land. On the vertical plane it “grew great . . . to
        the host of heaven,” and ultimately “magnified itself . . . up to the
        Prince of the host” (8:9-11).
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, the little horn was greater than the two powers that
        preceded it in the chapter, which means Antiochus IV should have
        exceeded the Media-Persian and Greek empires in greatness. Obviously, he
        didn't. He wasn't even close. Indeed, he ruled only one portion of the
        Grecian Empire, and did that with but little success
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conquests of the little horn</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The horn “grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and
        toward the glorious land.”
      </p>

      <p>
        To the south<strong><em>.</em></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The predecessor to Antiochus IV was the king who added Palestine to the
        territory ruled by the
      </p>

      <p>
        Seleucids when he defeated armies at Paneas in 198 B.C. Antiochus IV
        attempted to extend his southern frontier into Egypt with the campaign
        of 170-168 B.C. He was successful in conquering most of the Delta in 169
        B.C. The following year (168 B.C.) he marched on Alexandria but was
        turned back by a Roman diplomatic mission and had to abandon his
        Egyptian conquests. Thus his partial success in Egypt was transitory,
        and it is doubtful that he really did grow “exceedingly great toward the
        south.”
      </p>

      <p>To the east</p>
      <p>
        Antiochus IV's predecessor, not Antiochus IV himself, subjugated the
        east with his victorious campaigns of 210-206 B.C. that took him to the
        frontier of India. Most of the territories involved rebelled and became
        independent, however, after the Romans defeated him at Magnesia.
        Antiochus IV attempted to regain some of this territory. After some
        initial diplomatic and military successes, his forces stalled. He died
        during the course of these campaigns, apparently from natural causes, in
        the winter of 164/3 B.C. Antiochus IV did have some initial successes,
        he did not accomplish nearly as much in this area as his predecessor,
        and this project was left incomplete at Antiochus IV's death.
      </p>

      <p>To the glorious land</p>
      <p>
        Antiochus IV is noted in 1 Maccabees 1-6 as the ruler who desecrated the
        temple and persecuted the Jews. This did not occur because of any
        conquest of his own, but because his predecessor had already taken
        Palestine. Antiochus IV, therefore, could not have “grown exceedingly
        great toward the glorious land” (Judea, presumably) in any sense of
        military conquest. He could have “[grown] exceedingly” only in the sense
        of exercising or abusing his control over what was already part of his
        kingdom when he came to the throne. While he was campaigning in the
        east, his Palestinian forces were beaten (1 Macc 3:57; 4:29) in Judea.
        Toward the end of 164 B.C. the Jews liberated the polluted temple from
        their hands and rededicated it (1 Macc 5:52
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anti-temple activities</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The phrase, “the place of his sanctuary was cast down” (8:11, KJV)
        indicates what was done to the temple building, God's dwelling place
        itself, by the little horn. He did not damage its architecture in any
        significant way
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Little horn comes in the latter time of the four kingdoms</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Seleucid dynasty consisted of a line of more than 20 kings who ruled
        from 311 to 65 B.C., and Antiochus IV was the eighth in line of those
        kings (he ruled from 175 to 164/3 B.C.). Because more than a dozen
        Seleucids ruled after him, and fewer than a dozen ruled before him, he
        hardly arose “at the latter end of their rule
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>2300 days of rule are not fulfilled</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The precise dates for this are well established, and they covered a
        period of exactly <strong>three years and ten days</strong> not the 2300
        literal days (six years, four and two-thirds months)
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vision is about the time of the end</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        “<em
          >Understand, O son of man that the vision is for the time of the end”
          (8:17). At the beginning of his actual explanation Gabriel again
          emphasized this point by stating, “Behold, I will make known to you
          what shall be at the latter end of the indignation; for it pertains to
          the appointed time of the end”</em
        >
        (8:19). The phrases, “the time of the end” and “the appointed time of
        the end,” are also essential for a correct identity of the little horn.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a bare chronological minimum Daniel's time prophecies (Dan 9:24-27)
        had to extend to the time of the Messiah, Jesus, in the first century
        AD. Therefore, there is no way that Antiochus, who died in 164/3 B.C.,
        fits with “the time of the end.”
