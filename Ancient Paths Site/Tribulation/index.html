            <h2>Seven Year Tribulation</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>The
                    concept of a seven-year period of tribulation is actually <em>the underlying foundation </em>of the
                    entire rapture
                    period. The
                    theory is: rapture happens first, then seven years of tribulation where God
                    rescues the church</p>

                <h2>Background of the seven years</h2>
                <p>Where
                    does this “seven-year” concept come from anyway? </p>
                <p>From Genesis to Revelation, there is <strong>no exact passage that specifically mentions
                        a seven-year period</strong> of tribulation.</p>
                <p>The
                    entire theory is really based on a rather speculative interpretation of one
                    week of Daniel 9:27 .the week is part of the seventy weeks prophecy</p>
                <p>Daniel
                    9:24-27 contains a prophecy from the angel Gabriel to encourage the Jewish
                    people that they would be given a “second chance” to return to Jerusalem,
                    rebuild their temple, and ultimately, receive their Messiah (Jesus Christ).This
                    highly controversial prophecy literally reads:</p>
                <p><strong><em>Seventy weeks</em></strong><em> are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,
                        to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation
                        for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the
                        vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and
                        understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to
                        build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and
                        threescore and two weeks [62 weeks]: the street shall be built again, and the
                        wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah
                        be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come
                        shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a
                        flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. And he shall
                        confirm the covenant with many for <strong>one
                            week</strong>: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
                        oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it
                        desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined </em><em>be poured upon the desolate
                    </em><em>(Daniel
                        9:24-27 KJV).</em></p>
                <p>Gabriel then subdivides the period
                    into three smaller periods which when added total to 70 weeks (7+62+1=70)</p>

                    according to countless modern interpreters, Daniel 9:27 is applied to a <strong>future

                    <strong>a future peace treaty</strong> made with Israel, <strong>a future seven-year
                        tribulation</strong>,
                    and <strong>a future rebuilt Jewish temple inside Jerusalem</strong>. And all of this
                    will supposedly start with the rapture.

                <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Evidence
                        against the tie shift</strong></p>


                <h2>United seventy weeks </h2>
                <p>The
                    entire prophecy of Daniel 9:24-27 covers a period of “seventy weeks.” Reason
                    and Logic requires that “seventy weeks” refers to one consecutive block of
                    time, in other words, to seventy <em>straight sequential weeks.</em></p>
                <p><em>All </em>biblical
                    references to time are consecutive: 40 days and 40 nights (see Genesis 7:4),
                    400 years in Egypt (see Genesis 15:13), 70 years of captivity (see Daniel 9:2),
                    among others. In Daniel's prophecy, the “seventy weeks” were to begin during
                    the reign of Persia and continue to the time of the Messiah.</p>


                <h2>Counting issue:</h2>
                <p>In
                    terms of counting, the 70th week follow immediately after the 69th week. If it
                    doesn't, then it cannot properly be called the 70th week!</p>
                <p><strong>Unexplained gap</strong></p>
                <p>There
                    is no reason from the scripture to insert a 2,000-year gap between the 69<sup>th</sup>
                    and 70th There is no gap between the first seven weeks and the following
                    sixty-two weeks, so why insert one between the 69th and 70th week?</p>



                <h2>Extra end time details not mentioned in last week</h2>
                <p>Daniel
                    9:27 says nothing about <strong>a seven-year
                        period of “tribulation,”</strong> a <strong>“rebuilt”
                        Jewish temple</strong>, or any “antichrist.” These are interpretations that are <strong><em>read
                            into the text and not from the text</em></strong></p>
                <h2>The word covenant apples to Christ not antichrist</h2>
                <p>“He
                    shall confirm the covenant.” Paul said “the covenant” was “confirmed before by
                    God in Christ” (Galatians 3:17). Jesus Christ came “to <em>confirm </em>the
                    promises made to the fathers” (Romans 15:8, emphasis added). In the King James
                    Version, Daniel 9:27 doesn’t say “<em>a </em>covenant”
                    or peace treaty, but “<em>the
                    </em>covenant,” which applies to the
                    New Covenant.</p>
                <p>The
                    word “covenant” is Messianic, and <em>always </em>applies
                    to the Messiah, not the antichrist. Nowhere in the Bible does the antichrist
                    make, confirm, or break a covenant with anyone</p>


                <h2>The confirmed covenant with many</strong></h2>
                <p>Jesus
                    Christ said, “This is My blood of the new <em>covenant, </em>which is
                    shed for <em>many…</em>” (Matthew 26:28). Jesus was quoting Daniel 9:27
                    specifically.</p>

                <h2>Stopping sacrifices after three and a half years</h2>
                <p>“In
                    the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease<strong>.” <em>After
                            exactly three and a half years of holy ministry, Jesus Christ died on the
                            cross, “in the midst of the week [in the middle of the seven years].” </em></strong></p>
                <p>At
                    the exact moment of His death, “the veil of the temple was torn in two from top
                    to bottom…” (Matthew 27:51). This act of God signified that all animal
                    sacrifices at that moment ceased to be of value. Why? Because the Perfect
                    Sacrifice had been offered!</p>


                <h2>Desolation of Jerusalem</h2>
                <p>Jesus
                    clearly applied the abomination of desolation n Daniel 9 to the time when His
                    followers were to flee from Jerusalem before the destruction of the second
                    temple in A.D. 70. (Matthew 24:15)</p>
                <p>In
                    a parallel text to Matthew 24:15, Jesus told His disciples, “When you see
                    Jerusalem surrounded by armies [Roman armies led by Prince Titus], <em>then know that its desolation
                        is
                        near</em>” (Luke 21:20, emphasis added).</p>
                <p>The disciples did “see” those very events.
                    Because of the “abominations” of the Pharisees, Jesus told them,</p>
                <p><em>“See! Your house is left to you desolate” (Matthew
                        23:38).</em></p>
                <p>Thus
                    Gabriel's statement in Daniel 9:27 about Jerusalem becoming “desolate” was
                    perfectly fulfilled in A.D. 70.</p>


                <h2>Jesus and his ministry to the Jews</strong></h2>
                <p>Gabriel
                    said that the 70-week prophecy specifically applied to the Jewish people (see
                    Daniel 9:24). During the period of Christ's public ministry of 31/2 years, the Master's focus was
                    largely
                    upon “the lost sheep of
                    the house of Israel” (Matthew 10:6). After His resurrection and then for
                    another 31/2 years, His disciples preached
                    mostly to Jews (see Acts 1-6). </p>
                <p>After
                    that second 31/2-year period, in 34 A.D., the bold
                    Stephen was stoned by the Jewish Sanhedrin (see Acts 7). This infamous deed
                    marked the then-ruling Jewish leaders' final, official rejection of the gospel
                    of our Savior. <em>Then </em>the gospel went to the Gentiles. In Acts 9, Saul became Paul,
                    the “apostle to the Gentiles” (Romans 11:13). In Acts 10, God gave Peter a
                    vision revealing it was <em>now
                        time </em>to preach to the Gentiles (see
                    Acts 10:1-28).</p>


                <h2>Jesus and the forgive 490 times passage</h2>
                <p>When
                    Jesus was asked by Peter, how often one should forgive .He gave the answer of
                    490 times which was a reference to the 490 years given to Isreal to accept the
                    gospel and be saved or else the Romans would destroy their temple</p>
                <p><em>Then came
                        Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I
                        forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until
                        seven times: but, <strong>Until seventy times
                            seven</strong>.(Mat 18:21-22 KJV</em><em>, emphasis added</em><em>)</em></p>

                <h2>Tribulation: an attribute of the saints</h2>
                <p>If you look up “tribulation” in a <em>Strong's </em>or <em>Young's
                        Concordance, </em>you
                    may be shocked to discover that almost every reference describes what believers
                    suffer <em>through.
                        Tribulation basically refer to Christians persecuted for their faith and not
                        the unbelieving people</em></p>
                <p>If the majority of the Bible's “tribulation texts”
                    refer to what believers go <em>through, </em>why would</p>
                <p>God's Word suddenly shift gears by teaching that “<em>the </em>tribulation” is something
                    believers will <em>not
                    </em>go through?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Jesus
                        told His followers, “In the world <em>you </em>will have <em>tribulation</em>” (John 16:33,

                        added). Paul told his early
                        Christian converts, “…we must through many <em>tribulations </em>enter the kingdom of God” (Acts
                        14:22, emphasis added). </li>
                    <li>Paul
                        wrote to the church at Thessalonica, “…we ourselves boast of you among the
                        churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and <em>tribulations that
                            you endure</em>”
                        (2 Thessalonians 1:4, emphasis added).</li>
                    <li>On
                        the lonely isle of Patmos, John was our “companion in <em>tribulation</em>” (Revelation 1:9,
                        emphasis
                        added). </li>
                    <li>Jesus
                        told His church in Smyrna, “I know your works [and] <em>tribulation</em>…” (Revelation2:9,
                        emphasis
                        added).</li>
