    <h1>THE THREE ELIJAHS</h1>
    <p>
      Malachi 4:5, 6: The role of Elijah is to bring God's people back to the
      Lord—to bring them out of apostasy to worship the true God once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great
      and dreadful day of the LORD. 6 And he will turn the hearts of the fathers
      to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I
      come and strike the earth with a curse."
    </p>

    <p>Two phases</p>
    <p>
      The dark ages were gruesome and all Christians could have been killed, but
      God shortened the dark ages (Mat_24:22) and he wounded the beast to give
      the church room to grow again (half time). The beast will be healed, and
      the persecution will continue with stronger power, and this time both
      church and beast are worldwide.
    </p>
