  <h1>The Two Isreals</h1>
  <p>There are Jewish people in the flesh and Jewish people
    in the Spirit</p>

  <p><em>For
      he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward
      in the flesh; but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of
      the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but
      from God” (Romans 2: -29)</em></p>

      <td>Testimony of Paul</td>
      <td>Paul wrote, “Just as Abraham 'believed God, and it was
        accounted to him for righteousness.' Therefore know that only those who are of
        faith are sons of Abraham” (Galatians 3:6-7). Paul's argument is that because
        Abraham was a man of faith, <strong>only those
          who have faith are his spiritual children. We might call this the concept of
          “faith lineage.”</strong></td>

      <td>Testimony of John the Baptist</td>
      <td>John the Baptist preached the same when he told the Jewish
        leaders And do not think to
        say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.'' For I say to you that God
        is able to <strong>raise up children to Abraham
          from these stones</strong>. And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees.
        Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into
        the fire” (Matthew 3:9-10, emphasis added).</em><br>
        Those Pharisees and Sadducees didn't have real faith
        like Abraham did, yet they claimed to be his children. John the Baptist exposed
        this delusion.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Testimony of Jesus</td>
      <td>Jesus Christ taught the same truth. A certain group of
        Jewish people once said to Him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus responded<strong><em>, </em></strong><br>
        <strong><em>“If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works
            of Abraham” (John 8:39</em></strong>) <br>
        They also claimed to be Abraham's children, but they
        lacked true faith. By saying <strong><em>“If you were Abraham's children,” Jesus denied their
            claim.</em></strong><em> Christ continued, “But
          now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from
          God. <strong>Abraham did not do this. You do the
            deeds of your father”</strong></em><strong> (John 8:40-41).<strong><br>
            “We have one Father—God,” they countered. “Jesus said
            to them, 'If God were your Father, you would love me…<strong>You are of your father the devil</strong>, and
            the
            desires of your father
            you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the
            truth, because there is no truth in him.<em>When
              he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the
              father of it' ”</em> (John 8:41-42, 44).

  <p>What an atomic text! Jesus was talking to some Jewish
    people who claimed to be Israelites, the children of Abraham, yet they were
    only following God outwardly, not in heart. Jesus said they weren't really
    Abraham's children at all because they lacked true faith and were following
    lies. Their lineage actually went back to Satan, the first liar</p>
