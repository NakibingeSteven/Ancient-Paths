  <h1>1948 Restoration of Isreal State(Which Isreal?)</h1>

  <h2>Restoration in 1948</h2>
  <p>On
    May 14, empowered by a resolution of the United Nations, <strong>the Zionist Movement proclaimed the rebirth of the
      State of Israe</strong>l.
    For almost 2,000 years the Jewish people had been “wanderers among the
    nations.” Now they were home. Yet their struggles had just begun.</p>
  <p>An Arab League composed of Egyptians, Iraqis, Syrians, and Jordanians quickly
    invaded Palestine in an attempt to crush out the new nation</p>
  <p>Yet
    by 1949 the Arabs were defeated, and Israel was still in the land. In May of
    1967, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria prepared for another attack. The Israelis struck
    first, and the war was over in six days. In 1973, at the beginning of the
    Jewish season of Yom Kippur, the Egyptians and Syrians attacked again. The
    battles were fierce and bloody. Yet by 1974, Israel was again on top and still
    in the land.</p>
  <p>For
    more than 50 years <strong>these astonishing
      events have gripped the attention of much of the Christian world</strong>. A
    conclusion has been reached by millions: <strong>This
      must be the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.</strong> The rebirth of the State of
    Israel in 1948 is now considered by countless Christians to be the most
    significant prophetic event of the 20th century.</p>
  <p>In
    many ways, the <strong>1948 theory is like the </strong><strong><em>Titanic.
      </em></strong><strong>In
      the minds of countless believers, it is considered unsinkable. A true witness
      to the truth of the importance of literal state of Isreal in end time events</strong> .However, in a few moments,
    when this popular theoryhits the ice of God's Word, it sinks since
    it has no real biblical basis</p>


  <h2>Arguments for 1948</h2>
  <p>Three
    main arguments are used to support the theory that Bible prophecy was fulfilled
    in 1948.</p><br>

  <h3>Budding of the fig tree</h3>
  <p>The
    passage quoted for this is </p>
  <p><em>"Let
      the fig tree teach you a lesson. <strong>When
        its branches become green and tender and it starts putting out leaves, you know
        that summer is near. In the same way, when you see all these things, you will
        know that the time is near, ready to begin</strong>.(Mat 24:32-33 GNB</em><em>, emphasis added</em><em>)</em>
  </p>
  <p>The
    claim is that when the Jewish people…became a nation again on 14 May 1948 the
    'fig tree' put forth its first leaves. This is far from the truth because a
    parallel passage in Luke says something different</p>
  <p><em>Then
      Jesus told them this parable: "Think of <strong>the fig tree and all the other trees.</strong> When you see their
      leaves
      beginning to appear, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you
      see these things happening, you will know that the Kingdom of God is about to
      come.</em><em> </em><em>(Luk 21:29-31 GNB)</em></p>
  <p>Luke
    wrote, <strong><em>“The fig tree and </em></strong><strong><em>all </em></strong><strong><em>the
        trees</em></strong>” hence we clearly see Jesus did
    not have in mind just one tree representing Israel in 1948. The fig tree budding is not the sign but was used as an
    analogy for the signs of the end. It simply represents “all” the signs in Matthew
    24, none of which is the specified rebirth of Israel in 1948.</p><br>


  <h3>The miraculous victories of Isreal and end time regatheringargument</h3>
  <p>Many
    view the Israeli victories in 1949, 1967, and 1973 as strong evidence that God
    had regathered Israel and was now fighting for His chosen nation, even though <strong><em>the
        leadership of that nation still firmly rejects its own Messiah</em></strong></p>
  <p>The
    idea is now being expressed all around the globe that ancient prophecies which
    predicted regathering of Israel back to their land were fulfilled in 1948. The
    main prophecy quoted is found in Ezekiel chapters 36-38.</p>
  <p>Again,
    God does not change (see Malachi 3:6). All throughout sacred history, He could
    not fight for Israel while they were in unbelief. Thus He could not have been
    fighting for the Jewish nation in 1949, 1967, and 1973.</p>
  <p>Because
    a nation wins battles is not evidence in itself that God is fighting for that
    nation. Was God fighting for Hitler when he won so many battles? Was the Lord
    with the Nazis when they successfully incinerated so many Jews in crematoriums?
    Obviously not!</p><br>

  <h3>The reason for scattering</h3>
  <p>The
    reason <strong>Israel was scattered in Old
      Testament times was because she forsook God, broke His law, and disobeyed His
      word (see Jeremiah 16:10-13; 29:18-19</strong>). If you look carefully, according to
    the same Old Testament passages, <strong>Israel
      must </strong><strong><em>first </em></strong><strong>repent of her sins before such a regathering can be
      accomplished by God</strong></p>
  <p>God
    told Israel: <em>“It shall come to pass, when
      all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse…and you shall call
      them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God drives you, and you
      shall <strong>return to the Lord your God and
        obey His voice…</strong></em><strong><em>then </em></strong><strong><em>the Lord
        your God will bring you back from captivity…and gather you again from all the nations”</em></strong><em>
      (Deuteronomy
      30:1-3, KJV emphasis added).</em></p>
  <p><em>'If you people of Israel <strong>are unfaithful to me, I will scatter you
        among the other nations</strong>. But then if you turn back to me and do what I have
      commanded you<strong>, I will bring you back to
        the place where I have chosen to be worshiped, even though you are scattered to
        the ends of the earth</strong>.'</em></p>
  <p><em>(Neh 1:8-9 GNB</em><em>,emphasis added</em><em>)</em></p>
  <p><em>“And you
      will seek Me and find Me, when you</em><em> </em><em>search
      for Me with all your heart. I will be found by you,</em><em> </em><em>says the Lord, and I will bring you back
      from your
      captivity<strong>;</strong></em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>I will gather you from all the
        nations”</em></strong><em> (Jeremiah</em><em> </em><em>29:13-14).</em></p>
  <p>Ezekiel
    36 the verse quoted as fulfilled in 1948 contains conditional element<em>s that were not fulfilled. </em></p>
  <p><em>“Thus says the Lord God: 'On the day that I cleanse you
      from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and
      the ruins shall be rebuilt” (Ezekiel 36:33). </em></p>
  <p>Thus,
    “on the day” God cleanses Israel from “all” of her sins, on that day He would
    “also enable” her to dwell in her cities. This did not happen in 1948.</p>
  <p><em>Israel as a nation was not cleansed from “all” her
      iniquities at that time. Especially had it not forsaken its Heaven-confronting
      sin of rejecting God's Son (see Matthew 21:37-39).</em></p>

  <p>Note:</p>
  <p>Because
    the Messiah has come, this “return to the Lord” must include fully embracing
    Jesus Christ. The facts of history reveal that Jewish Zionism did not meet this
    spiritual condition in 1948. </p>
  <p>These
    Scriptures are plain. Israel must first repent, <em>then </em>God will
    gather her. Once again, this condition was not met by the Zionist movement in
    1948</p>
