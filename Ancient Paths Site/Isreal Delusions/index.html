            <h2>Many Views Aout Isreal</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>These are three main views when it comes to interpreting Isreal as people in the Bible </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Replacement Theology</li>
                    <li>Separation Theology</li>
                    <li>Restoration Theology</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Most people studying prophecy today take the third view that all the End times events rotate around
                    the Middle East, Jerusalem, and the Jews and this is understandable because most of the Bible events
                    and prophecies
                    though they might be global in scope they use Middle Eastern language for example Babylon (Modern
                    Iraq),
                    River Euphrates in the Middle East are examples of language used literally,prophetically and
                    figuratively in the Bible.But before picking any interpretation a number of questions have to be
                    considered by the interpretation we have chosen</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>What did Paul mean when he wrote, <b>"They are not all Israel who are of Israel"</b>
                        (Romans9:6)?</li>
                    <li>Whydoes the New Testament refer to <b>two Israels</b> namely one <b>'Israel after the flesh"</b>
                        (1 Corinthians 10:18) and <b>"the Israel of God" (Galatians 6:14-16)</b> in Jesus
                        Christ?</li>
                    <li>What is the true meaning of Revelation's mysterious prophecies about 144,000 from
                        all <b>the tribes of Israel and yet not all tribes are listed?</b></li>
                    <li>What
                        is the true meaning of Revelation's mysterious prophecies about Mystery
                        Babylon and yet Baylon is a fallen empire?</li>
                    <li>What is the true
                        meaning of Revelation's mysterious prophecies about Euphrates River running
                        dry, an occurence similar to the conquering of Babylon By Cyrus? </li>
                    <li>What is the true
                        meaning of Revelation's mysterious prophecies about Armageddon, “the battle of
                        that great day of God Almighty” (Revelation 7:4; 16:13-16; 17:5)?</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Spiritual vs Literal Question</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>To any reader of the Bible, Revelation uses the terminology and geography of the Middle
                    East in its prophecies and so it is not unueal to discover statements
                    about “Mount Zion” (14:1), “the twelve tribes of Israel” (7:4-8), “Jerusalem”
                    (21:10), “the temple” (11:19), “Sodom and Egypt” (11:8), “Babylon” (17:5), “Gog
                    and Magog” (20:8), “the great river Euphrates” (16:12), and “Armageddon” (16:16).</p>

                <p>One interesting question to consider is did God intend for these prophecies to
                    be literally applied to "Israel after the flesh" (1 Corinthians 10:18), or
                    should they be applied to "the Israel of God" (Galatians 6:16) in Jesus Christ? Some answers to this
                    have led
                    many to adopt a rapture point of view to tkae teh church out of the picture nd apply a literal
                    meaning to these passages
                    but this is in the face of the many applications of literal Old Testament peoples,stories,scripture
                    which had their own literal meanings to represent spiritual things or things that expand greatly
                    beyond their initial context to the worldwide church beyond Isreal.</p>
                <p>Some examples of this Cases are shown below </p>

                <h3>Seven branched candlestick as the churches</h3>
                <p>In Revelation, John
                    beheld the Christ walking "in the midst of the seven lampstands" (verse 13) taking our minds back to
                    the literal seven-branched candlestick inside the Jewish temple before it was destroyed in 70 A.D.
                    by
                    Roman armies but while explaining the mystery of the visions it is interpreted as “…the seven
                    lampstands which you saw <em>are the seven churches</em>” (Revelation
                    1:20, emphasis added)</p>

                <p>Thus,
                    in Revelation's very first chapter, <strong>Jesus
                        took something extremely Jewish and used it symbolically to represent His
                        Church.</strong> As we shall see, this is one of the key interpretive principles to
                    understanding the entire Book</p>

                <h3>The woman jezebel</strong></h3>
                <p>In
                    Revelation 2, in a dictated letter to “the church in Thyatira” (verse 18),
                    Jesus reproved His people for allowing "that
                    woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My
                    servants…" (Verse 20).</em> </p>

                <p>Jezebel
                    was a wicked woman in Old Testament times who entered Israel and caused
                    problems. Was Jesus saying “Jezebel” had been reincarnated, or resurrected, and
                    was literally teaching deception within Thyatira?</p>

                <p>A
                    little reflection reveals He used the word, “Jezebel,” as a <em>symbol </em>of an
                    evil movement that was affecting His Church. As with the seven golden
                    candlesticks, <strong>God's Messiah took
                        something from Jewish history and applied it to His Church, “the Israel of God”
                        (Galatians 6:16).</strong></p>

                <h3>The drying of the river Euphrates</h3>
                <p> Revelation also talks abput river Euphrates drying up before Armageddon? The
                    Word says, <em>"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river
                        Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the
                        east might be prepared” (Revelation 16:12). </em></p>

                <p><b>Literal interpretations would tell us: </b>
                <ol>
                    <li>This applies to the literal river Euphrates flowing
                        near Baghdad, which the
                        American troops crossed in Operation Iraqi Freedom?</li>
                    <li>Or as some influenced by Modern geography predict that the
                        "kings of the east" are Chinese kings or warriors whose foot
                        soldiers will someday cross a dry riverbed before attacking Israel at
                        Armageddon and that somehow Revelation 16:12 will fulfilled this way</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p><b>Spiritual interpretation backed by Literal Old Testament would tell us: </b>
                <ol>
                    <li>In 605 B.C., Babylon conquered Jerusalem and took the
                        Jews captive for 70 years (see Daniel 9:2). After 70 years, an amazing set of
                        circumstances occurred. The Euphrates was dried up, Babylon was conquered from
                        the east, and Israel was delivered. This forms the background for a true
                        understanding of Revelation 16:12.</li>
                    <li>Ancient
                        Babylon sat on the river Euphrates (see Jeremiah 51:63-64), and was surrounded
                        by a massive wall of protection. The Euphrates flowed through Babylon, entering
                        and exiting through two gates in the wall whose bars reached down to the
                        riverbed. When those two gates, or “double doors” were completely shut and all
                        other entrances were closed, Babylon was impregnable. Yet she was to fall
                        suddenly and be destroyed (see Jeremiah 51:8)</li>
                    <li>Then
                        God would call Israel, saying, “My people, go out of the midst of her!”
                        (Jeremiah 51:45) As we shall soon see, these exact words are repeated in
                        Revelation to God's spiritual Israel about the necessity of coming out of
                        Mystery Babylon (see Revelation 17:4-5; 18:2-8).</li>
                    <li>In
                        538 B.C., on the night of ancient Babylon's fall, her king and subjects were
                        drunk with wine (see Daniel 5). So were the guards, and they forgot to fully
                        close the double doors. Over 100 years earlier, God had predicted concerning
                        Babylon and the Euphrates, “I will dry up your rivers” (Isaiah (44:27).</li>
                    <li>John
                        saw the harlot sitting “on many waters,” just like ancient Babylon sat upon the
                        Euphrates river. Yet in Revelation, these “many waters” do not refer to the
                        literal river Euphrates which today flows near Saddam Hussein's bombed-out
                        Iraqi palaces. No! Revelation's angel interpreter said, “The waters which you
                        saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues”
                        (Revelation 17:15).</li>

                <p>Middle
                    East literalism fails miserably to discern the true meaning and genius of the
                    Book of Revelation. It also misses the fact that Revelation is simply using Old
                    Testament terms, history, and geography as symbols just liek teh examples in the previous section
                    pointed out</p>

                <p>In
                    1887, H. Grattan Guinness insightfully wrote <br><em>Futurism is literalism, and literalism in the
                        interpretation of symbols is a denial of their symbolic character. It is an
                        abuse and degradation of the prophetic word, and a destruction of its
                        influence. It substitutes the imaginary for the real, the grotesque and
                        monstrous for the sober and reasonable(H. Grattan Guinness, Romanism and the Reformation,
                        163)</em></p>

                <p>The
                    error of those who adopt the “literal Middle-East method” of interpretation
                    arise from </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The belief that these prophecies
                        must apply to Israel after the flesh,</li>
                    <li>A failure to study the Old
                        Testament's “root” history behind Revelation's prophecies, </li>
                    <li>A failure to apply that history
                        spiritually and universally to God's Israel, the Church </li>
                    <li><em>A
                            failure to center</em> <em>Revelation entirely in Jesus Christ and His global
                            enemies</em>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>This
                    issue can be compared to the wearing of two different pairs of glasses. If we
                    put on the “literal Middle-East glasses” we will “see” Revelation's prophecies
                    as applying only to literal places and Israel after the flesh. But if we put on
                    the “Middle-East symbolism glasses” and read Revelation through the Spirit's
                    aid, we will "see" these prophecies applying to the Israel of God</p>

            <h2>The 144000 Question</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>God's final remnant is referred to in prophecy as the
                    144,000 (see Revelation 14:1-5). They are described as coming from “all the
                    tribes of the children of Israel” (Revelation 7:4). <strong>Does this mean they are all literal
                        Jews?</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <h2>Church and Isreal united</strong></h2>
                </ul>
                <p>We have previously seen that Paul wrote that <strong>Jews
                        and Gentiles are now “one</strong>” and are part of “the same body” through Jesus
                    Christ (Ephesians 2:14; 3:4-6). Does the last Book in the Bible contradict
                    Paul's writings? Does Revelation rebuild a wall between Jews and Gentiles that
                    Jesus Christ abolished at the cross? Of course not!</p>

                <ul>
                    <h2>Jerusalem and mount Zion not in Isreal</strong></h2>
                </ul>

                <p>The
                    144,000 are described as standing on “Mount Zion” with the Lamb (Revelation
                    14:1). Mount Zion is where Jerusalem sits. <strong>Yet
                        in Revelation,</strong><strong> “</strong><strong>Mount Zion” does not
                        refer to any mountain in the Middle East</strong>. John
                    wrote,</p>
                <p><em>“And he carried me away in <strong>the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the
                            great city,
                            the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God</strong>” (Revelation 21:10)</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <h2>Isreal according to James</strong></h2>
                </ul>
                <p>In
                    the New Testament, James wrote his <em>letter
                        “to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad” (James 1:1).</em> Who were
                    these twelve tribes? In the next sentence James called them, “My brethren.”
                    Then he wrote to them about <em>“the testing
                        of [their] faith” (James 1:3).</em> Thus, these “twelve tribes,” which James
                    wrote to as a unit, were believers in Christ. In the same letter, he counseled
                    those from among these “twelve tribes” who were sick to “call for the elders of
                    the church” for special prayer (James 5:14). Thus to James, the “twelve tribes”
                    were definitely part of the Church.</p>

                <ul>
                    <h2>The 144000 and Jesus</strong></h2>
                </ul>
                <p>The
                    144,000 “follow the Lamb wherever He goes” (Revelation 14:1, 4). Therefore they
                    are Christians who love Jesus. They are “not defiled with women, for they are
                    virgins” (Revelation 14:4). This does not mean the 144,000 is composed of only
                    literal, Jewish, unmarried, or celibate men. If so, this would be teaching mass
                    celibacy, a dogma which Paul called a “doctrine of demons” (1 Timothy 4:1-3).
                    In 2 Corinthians 11:2, Paul also used the word “virgin,” and he applied it to
                    the Church.</p>

                <p>What
                    about the 144,000 not being “defiled with women”? This is contrasting them with
                    the harlot Revelation 17, who is their opposite as she fornicates with the
                    kings of the earth.</p>
