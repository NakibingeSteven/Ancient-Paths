        blessings of his father from his elder brother Esau.</td>

      <td>Guilt and Consequencs of his sin</td>
      <td>Jacob hidffrom his family with relatives in a far country,
        where he remained for 20 years (see Genesis 27:43; 31:41). Jacob never saw his
        mother's face again.</td>

      <td>Fear of Punishment for their sins</td>
      <td>Twenty years
        later Jacob headed home. Surrounded by a large caravan of family and servants,
        he sent messengers ahead of the group to tell Esau he was coming. But the men
        returned with the news <strong>that Esau and 400
          soldiers</strong> were on their way to meet him. Fear gripped Jacob's heart.<strong> He felt
          a deep sense of guilt over his past sin
          of deception and was terrified for the safety of his family</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wrestling with God for forgiveness</td>
      <td>So Jacob "arose
        that night” and “was left alone" to plead and wrestle with God for forgiveness
        and deliverance (Genesis 32:22, 24).This Man was
        really “the Angel” (Hosea 12:4). Unaware of this, and assuming this must be his
        still-angry brother Esau, Jacob struggled all night for his life. At the crack
        of dawn, this powerful Stranger revealed Himself, not as a foe, but as a
        heavenly Friend. He touched Jacob's hip, “and the socket of Jacob's hip was out
        of joint as He wrestled with him” (verse 25).</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Forgiven and blessed</td>
      <td>Jacob suddenly
        realized this powerful Being was now his only hope. Broken and helpless, he
        clung to the Messenger, saying, “I will not let you go unless You bless me!
        “the angels blessed Jacob and changes his name to Isreal</td>

      <td>Meaning behind the names</td>
      <td>“And He said, 'Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled
        with God and with men, and have prevailed' ” (verses 26-28, emphasis added)</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Significance of the Nme Isreal</td>
      <td>This is the first time the word "Israel" is used in the Bible, and <b>the context reveals its
          deep spiritual significance.</b> In the beginning, it was a special name given to only one man, to
        Jacob, by the
        Angel of God. Jacob literally meant, <b>“deceiver,” or “crook.”</b> When Esau
        discovered Jacob's sin of deception, he said to Isaac, “Is he not rightly named
        Jacob?” (Genesis 27:36) Thus the name, “Jacob,” was a description of his
        character and of his sin.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Changed man after wrestling with God</td>
      <td>When the Angel
        said, “What is your name?” He knew the answer. But He wanted Jacob to say his
        own name, which represented a humble confession and turning away from his sin.
        Jacob passed the test, repented, and placed his entire dependence upon God's
        love and mercy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Change of Name,Change of Character</td>
      <td>The response, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel," revealed that God had
        given him a new character. According to the margin of the New King James Bible,
        the word "Israel" literally means, "Prince with God."" <strong>Thus the name "Israel" itself was a spiritual
          name, symbolizing Jacob's spiritual victory over his past sin of deception.</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Isreal's blessing passed on to his children</td>
      <td>Israel had 12
        sons "who came to Egypt" (Exodus 1:1-5). The children of Israel multiplied in
        Egypt and were forced into slavery until the time of Moses. Then God told
        Moses, “Say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the Lord: 'Israel is My son, My firstborn….Let My
        son go'"" (Exodus 4:22-23).</td>
