  <h1>Armaggedon</h1>
  <p>"And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon”
    (Revelation 16:16). This is the only time the exact word <em>Armageddon </em>is
    used in the Bible. The truth is, there is no literal place called “Armageddon”
    anywhere in the world. This mysterious term is a combination of two words:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Ar, </em>which means “mountain,” </li>
    <li><em>…mageddon, </em>reminiscent
      of the ancient valley of Megiddo (see 2 Chronicles 35:22). In the</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Old Testament, Megiddo was a place of fierce battles and bloody slaughters</p>
  <p><strong>The frogs and Armageddon</strong></p>

  <p>The
    Book of Revelation talks about frogs and it connects them with the battle of
    Armageddon.</p>

  <p><em>“I saw three <strong>unclean spirits like frogs</strong> coming out of the mouth of the dragon,
      out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For
      they <strong>are spirits of demons, performing
        signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world</strong>, <strong>to gather them to the
        battle of that great
        day of God Almighty</strong>….And they gathered them together to the place called in
      Hebrew, Armageddon” (Revelation 16:13-14,16).</em></p>

  <p>A
    careful reading of Revelation 16:13-16 reveals that Armageddon involves a final
    global battle</p>

  <p>Between</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the dragon, the beast, the false prophet</li>
    <li>the three froglike spirits,</li>
    <li>The kings of the whole world, and God Almighty.<strong></strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The identity of the unholy union is revealed in other parts of
    Revelation. The “dragon” is a symbol of Satan himself (see Revelation 12:9).
    “The beast” represents the papal power. The “false prophet”—the third member of this unholy trinity—
    is also referred to as “another beast” with “two horns like a lamb” but which
    speaks as a dragon (see Revelation 13:11).</p>

  <h2>Beyond the Middle East</strong></h2>
  <p>The
    actual slaughter of Satan's global kingdom, Mystery Babylon is described
    immediately after “Armageddon” is mentioned</p>

  <p><em>“And they gathered them together to the place called in
      Hebrew, Armageddon. Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air,
      and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, ‘It
      is done!'' And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a
      great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since
      men were on the earth. Now <strong>the great
        city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell</strong>. And <strong>great Babylon was
        remembered before God,</strong>
      to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.</em></p>

  <p><em>Then every island fled away, and the mountains were not
      found” (Revelation 16:16-20).</em></p>

  <p>Contrary
    to the all-pervasive teaching of the third frog<strong>, these words clearly describe divine wrath upon
    </strong><strong><em>spiritual
      </em></strong><strong>Babylon
      and a </strong><strong><em>global </em></strong><strong>slaughter that reaches far beyond the Middle
      East</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Who is the gathering of earthly kingsat Armageddon really against? </strong></p>

  <p>Literal
    Jews? No! It is a gathering of the world forces of Mystery Babylon against the
    Warrior on the horse and against His army. The Warrior is King Jesus (see
    Revelation 19:11), but what about His army? Who will compose that holy
    battalion? It will be an army of “legions of angels” (Matthew 26:53) who return
    with King Jesus at His second coming (see Matthew 16:27; 24:31).</p>
