  <h1>Armaggedon</h1>
  <p>The name Isreal was given to Jacob a
    thief of his father blessing after he wrestled with an angel and pleaded with
    God to forgive him</p>

  <p>The man said,
    "<em>Your name will no longer be Jacob.
      You have struggled with God and with men, and you have won; so your name will
      be Israel."</em> (Gen 32:28 GNB)</p>

  <p><strong>Isreal, the true first
      born son of God</strong></p>
  <p>The lord calls Isreal his
    first son</p>
  <p><em>Then you must tell him that I, the LORD,
      say, 'Israel is <strong>my first-born son</strong>. I
      told you to let my son go, so that he might worship me, but you refused. Now I
      am going to kill your first-born son.'</em> "(Exo 4:22-23 GNB)</p>

  <p><em>When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called <strong>my son</strong> out of Egypt</em>.(Hos 11:1
    KJV)</p>

  <p>Mathew quotes Hos 11:1 which originally referred to Isreal when talking
    of Jesus in Matt 2:15</p>

  <p>The book of Mathew follows the
    story of Israel though Jesus showing that Jesus is the true Isreal, where they
    and failed Jesus Succeeds</p>
