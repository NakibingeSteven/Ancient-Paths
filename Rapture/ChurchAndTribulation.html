  <h1>Church always Under Tribulation</h1>
  <p>These two concepts come with the rapture package:</p>
  <p>1.The Church of Jesus Christ will escape the “tribulation.”</p>
  <p>2.Those who miss the rapture will have a second chance to be saved.</p>
  <p>Number 2 <em>can </em>be dangerous. Some might rationalize, “If the rapture takes
    place, then I'll know God is real</p>


  <h2>Brief history</h2>
  <p>All
    the disciples of Jesus, except John, were brutally murdered. Thousands of early
    Christians were torn to shreds by wild dogs inside the Coliseum. Millions of
    others were horribly tortured by the Inquisition and burnt to ashes during the
    Dark Ages (more on this later).Believers in Russia and China have suffered
    terribly under communism, and yet American Christians say, “God wouldn’t allow <em>us </em>to go
    through the tribulation!”</p>


  <h2>Tribulation: an attribute of the saints</h2>
  <p>If
    you look up “tribulation” in a <em>Strong's
    </em>or <em>Young's
      Concordance, </em>you may be shocked to discover
    that almost every reference describes what believers suffer <em>through. Tribulation basically refer to
      Christians persecuted for their faith and not the unbelieving people</em></p>
  <p>If
    the majority of the Bible's “tribulation texts” refer to what believers go <em>through, </em>why
    would</p>
  <p>God's
    Word suddenly shift gears by teaching that “<em>the </em>tribulation” is
    something believers will <em>not </em>go through?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jesus told His followers, “In the
      world <em>you </em>will have <em>tribulation</em>” (John 16:33, emphasis added). Paul told his early
      Christian
      converts, “…we must through many <em>tribulations
      </em>enter the kingdom of God” (Acts 14:22, emphasis added).
    </li>
    <li>Paul wrote to the church at
      Thessalonica, “…we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your
      patience and faith in all your persecutions and <em>tribulations that you endure</em>” (2 Thessalonians
      1:4, emphasis added).</li>
    <li>On the lonely isle of Patmos, John
      was our “companion in <em>tribulation</em>” (Revelation 1:9, emphasis added). </li>
    <li>Jesus told His church in Smyrna,
      “I know your works [and] <em>tribulation</em>…” (Revelation 2:9, emphasis added).</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>The arguments used</h2>
  <p><strong>No mention of church after Revelation 4</strong></p>
  <p>Many
    pro-rapture advocates also argue, “If the Church is going through the
    tribulation, then why isn't the Church mentioned after Revelation 4?”</p>

  <p>In
    Revelation 4:1, John was told to “come up here.” People conclude this
    represents the rapture and they think the Church isn't mentioned anymore. But</p>

  <ul>
    <li>John did not actually go to Heaven
      in Revelation 4:1; he was simply taken up <em>in a vision, </em>while
      his toes remained on Patmos.</li>
    <li>The Church <em>is </em>on Earth
      after Revelation 4. Because Revelation says the beast
      will make “war with the saints” (13:7), then we read about “the faith of the
      saints” (13:10), and finally, during the mark of the beast crisis, the
      apocalypse refers to “the saints” who keep “the faith of Jesus” (14:12).</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Church won't be here for Armageddon.</h2>
  <p>The
    word “Armageddon” is used only once in the entire Bible, in Revelation 16:16,
    which is the great chapter about the falling of the seven last plagues. Right
    before verse 16, <em>during </em>the time of the plagues, Jesus Christ thunders, </p>

  <p><em>“Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who
      watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame. And
      they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon”
      (Revelation 16:15-16).</em></p>
  <p>At
    the time of verse 15, <em>while </em>the seven plagues are falling, which is definitely <em>during </em>the
    tribulation, and <em>right before </em>the battle of Armageddon, Jesus Christ has not yet come as a
    thief!</p>
