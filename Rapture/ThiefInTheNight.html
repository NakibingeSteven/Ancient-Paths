  <h1>Thief In the Night</h1>
  <p>Paul compares the coming of Jesus Christ to the arrival of a
    midnight thief. Rapture promoters interpret this to mean Jesus will come like a
    silent thief to snatch believers off this earth</p>

  <p><em>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven
      with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And
      the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be
      caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
      thus we shall always be with the Lord.</em></p>

  <p><em>Therefore comfort one another with these words.
      But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I
      should write to you. For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord
      so comes as </em><strong><em>a thief in the night</em></strong><em>. For when they say, “Peace and
      safety!” then
      sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And
      they shall not escape </em>(1 Thessalonians
    4:16-5:3, emphasis added).</p>

  <p>The day when Jesus comes as a
    thief is clearly the very same day in which He descends with a shout and a
    trumpet blast. Secondly, it comes as “a thief in the night” only upon the
    unprepared.</p>

  <p><strong>Sudden
      not secret coming of the Lord</strong></p>

  <p>Jesus' coming as a “thief in the night”
    does not mean He will come quietly and invisibly to steal believers out of this
    world, as is taught in rapture movies and New York Times bestselling books.
    Rather, it means He will come unexpectedly, bringing “sudden destruction” upon
    the unsaved</p>

  <p>Immediately after his solemn
    prediction of Christ's return as a midnight thief, Paul wrote to true
    believers: “But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should
    overtake you as a thief. You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are
    not of the night nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:4-5).</p>

  <p>Paul wrote that true believers will someday be “caught up…
    in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17). But does
    “caught up” mean disappear? Is Paul describing a silent return of Jesus Christ
    before an apocalyptic seven-year tribulation?</p>
