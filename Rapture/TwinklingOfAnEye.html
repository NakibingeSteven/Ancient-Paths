  <h1>Twinkling Of An Eye</h1>
  <p>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We
    shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling
    of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
    be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.(1Co 15:51-52 KJV)</p>

  <p>Is
    Paul saying believers will someday vanish while their loved ones blink? Not at
    all! He is simply saying that the dead will be raised and our sinful bodies
    will be changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” <em>When</em> will
    this “moment” take place? Paul’s answer is clear. It will occur “at the <em>last</em>
    trumpet,” when “the trumpet will sound,” that is, at the very end of the world.</p>
