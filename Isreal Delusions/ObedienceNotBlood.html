  <h1>Convenant of Obedience not Blood</h1>

  <h2>Conditional Convenant</h2>
  <p>From atop of Mount Sinai, God Almighty thundered to Moses the conditons of the elections of his People,descendants
    of Isreal:</p>
  <p><em>“Thus you shall say to the house
      of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 'You have seen what I did to the
      Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself. Now
      therefore,</em><strong><em>if</em></strong><em> </em><em>you will indeed obey My voice and keep My
      covenant<strong>, </strong></em><strong><em>then</em></strong><em> </em><em>you shall be a special treasure to Me
      above all people;
      for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a
      holy nation' ” (Exodus 19:3-6, emphasis added).</em></p>

  <p>A quick parsing of the text will reveal the words 'if' and 'then.'' God said 'if' Israel obeyed, 'then' they would
    be His special treasure. That tiny word 'if' involves conditions. God's use of "if" made it clear
    that the <strong><em>continuation </em></strong> of His favor to the Israelites was
    conditional upon their response to His goodness, upon their choices to obey</strong> (see also 1 Samuel 2:30;
    Jeremiah 18:7-10).</p>

  <p>As
    God chose the chose people, so the chosen nation must themselves choose
    correctly, or the consequences would be disastrous</p>

  <h2>The loss of Gods favour</h2>
  <p>Despite the continual disobedience,God manifested His mercy by sending prophets and pleading with
    Israel to return to His covenant. Yet apostasy continued and deepened. Finally,
    after hundreds of years of warning, disaster struck.
  <ul>
    <li>In 722
      B.C., the northern tribes were carried away by the cruel Assyrians.</li>
    <li>In 586
      B.C., Judah was taken to Babylon, the armies of Babylon demolished Jerusalem
      and burned its temple with fire. The Jews were removed from their land and
      carried into captivity.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Yet,
    in the mercy of God, this exile was not to be permanent. The prophet Jeremiah
    predicted that God “would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
    Jerusalem” (Daniel 9:2). After 70 years the Jews would leave Babylon, return to
    their land, and rebuild their temple and their city. God was giving His chosen
    nation another chance to respond to His love.</p>

  <h2>The last opportunity to Israel</strong></h2>
  <p>There is a prophecy that prophesied the coming of the Messiah and the last probations for Isreal, their
    last opportunity reffred to aas the prophecy of the "seventy weeks,""
    revealed near the end of the Babylonian captivity by Gabriel to Daniel, </p>

  <p><em>"Seventy weeks are determined for
      your people and for your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end
      of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting
      righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy"
      (Daniel 9:24). </em></p>
  <p>This
    70-week period (490 years) was "determined" for Daniel's people, the Jews.
    During that period, the chosen nation would have another chance "to finish the
    transgression" and "to make an end of sins." Near the end of that period,
    something big would happen.</p>

  <p>The
    Messiah would come "to bring in everlasting righteousness."" As we shall soon
    see, Israel's status as a special nation under divine favor would then be
    determined by her choice to receive or reject that Messiah.</p>

  <p>Right
    after His baptism Jesus declared, “<em>The time is fulfilled, </em>and
    the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel”<em> </em>(Mark
    1:15, emphasis added). Christ's words, “The time is fulfilled,” can apply<em> </em>to
    <em>no other time prophecy
      except Daniel 9! </em>Jesus knew He was
    fulfilling that<em> </em>ancient prediction.
