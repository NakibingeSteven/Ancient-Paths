  <h1>Spiritual Isreal</h1>
  <h2>The future of literal, physical Israel</h2>
  <p>Years
    later, Paul wrote to believing Gentiles: <em>“Therefore
      remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh… (Ephesians 2:11-16).</em> Here
    Paul is quite clear. Believing non-Jews were “once Gentiles…aliens from the
    commonwealth of Israel.” But “now in Christ Jesus,” Jews and Gentiles have
    become “one.”</p>
  <p><em>“By which, when you read, you may understand my
      knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known to
      the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles
      and prophets: that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body”
      (Ephesians 3:4-6).</em></p>
  <p><em>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave
      nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
      Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). </em></p>
  <p>Pastors
    often say during marriage ceremonies, “What God has joined together, let no man
    separate!” This now applies to Jews and Gentiles in Jesus Christ.</p>


  <p>Paul poses a question about the future of the
    unbelieving Jews in relation to the Gospel, he writes <em>“Has God cast away His people?” (Romans 11:1).</em> These
    words are
    being quoted around the world to prove that God has not cast away any
    Israelites of the flesh. How can we explain this?</p>

  <h2>Some physical Israelites cast out</h2>
  <p>The same chapter does describe <strong>“the casting
      away” of some Jewish people who don't believe</strong> (Romans 11:15).</p>


  <h2>The end time application of Jezebel, the seven thousand and Elijah</h2>
  <p>Paul
    refers to Israel's apostasy in the days of Elijah. God told His prophet, “I
    have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to
    Baal” (Romans 11:4).</p>
  <p>In
    Elijah's time there were also <strong>two
      Israels: One followed Baal, the other followed God.</strong></p>
  <p>Then
    Paul made this pointed application. “Even so then, at this present time there
    is a remnant according to the election of grace” (Romans 11:5).</p>
  <p>Just
    as in Elijah's time there was a faithful remnant of Israel, even so in Paul's
    time there was also a faithful remnant of believing Jews, who, like himself,
    had been saved by grace. Based on the context of Romans 11:1-5, it is this
    faithful remnant of Israel, made up of Jews like Paul, which God has certainly
    not “cast away.”</p>
  <p>This
    exact issue is revealed in the Book of Revelation. As in the days of Elijah, we
    are now in the midst of a terrible apostasy. There exists terrible woman
    Jezebel (mystery Babylon) who is leading the world astray. Yet today God has
    His “seven thousand” who have not “bowed the knee to Baal.” </p>
  <p>They
    are His faithful remnant, His Israel in the Holy Spirit, who rely on God's
    power instead of their flesh. Like Elijah, they will be on the side of Jesus
    Christ and His truth at Armageddon.</p>

  <h2>Literal Isreal Remnant</h2>
  <p> Not all of Literal Isreal was divorced as many Jews were a part of the church and they welcomed their Messiah.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All 12
      disciples were Jewish.</li>
    <li>The Holy
      Spirit on the day of Pentecost fell only on Jews. </li>
    <li>It was
      3,000 Jews who were then baptized (see Acts 2:5, 22, 36, 41, 46).</li>
    <li>The
      early Church in Jerusalem was Jewish. </li>
    <li>Soon “a
      great many of the priests were obedient to the faith” (Acts 6:7).</li>
    <li>Apart
      from Luke, the entire New Testament was written by Jews.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The question must be asked, “Should we call this group of Jewish believers in
    Jerusalem 'Israel' or 'the Churc''?” It's obvious they were both!</p>
  <p>When
    Spirit-filled Stephen looked back into history, what did he call Israel in
    Moses' time? He called <strong>Israel<em>, “the </em></strong><strong><em>church </em></strong><strong><em>in the
        wilderness</em></strong>”
    (Acts 7:38, KJV, emphasis added). Thus, according to</p>
  <p>Stephen—whose
    backward glance was enlightened by Holy Ghost perception Old Testament Israel
    was God's Church!</p>

  <h2>The early church gentile confusion</h2>
  <p>As
    the early Jewish Church expanded into the Roman world, this question was
    finally raised: “Is our Messiah only for us? What about the Gentiles?” Then,
    unexpectedly, God's Spirit fell on non-Jews (see Acts 10:44-45).</p>
  <p>Slowly,
    narrowness and prejudice broke down. A Jewish council of believers convened in
    Jerusalem to discuss “the Jew-Gentile issue” (see Acts 15)</p>
  <p>In summary, there is one a <strong>oneness </strong>of the people of God, both Jew and Gentile</p>
