  <h1>Isreal's Divine Divorce</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>The
      first literal misapplication</h2>

    <p>Jesus continually told them the kingdom
      was no of this world but they never understood him</p>

    <p><em>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees,
        when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of
        God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there!
        for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.(</em>Luk 17:20-21 KJV)</p>

    <p><em>But we trusted that it had been he which
        should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since
        these things were done</em>.(Luk 24:21 KJV)</p>

    <p>Even the disciples didn't understand
      his mission and the type of Messiah he was up to his ascension</p>

    <p>When they
      therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at
      this time <strong>restore again the kingdom to
        Israel?</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>Act 1:6 KJV)</p>

    <h2>The extent of divine forgiveness</h2>
    <p><em>“Then came Peter to Him, and said, 'Lord, how often shall my
        brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?' Jesus said to
        him, 'I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven'”
        (Matthew 18:21-22).</em></p>

    <p>Christ's
      response to Peter's question is quite interesting. While He obviously was not
      saying that human forgiveness toward offenders should have a limit, “seventy
      times seven” equals 490, which just might have been a subtle reference to the
      70-week prophecy of Daniel 9!</p>

    <p>The 70-week
      period represented another opportunity for the chosen nation to demonstrate
      faithfulness to God. Israel's first temple had been destroyed and her children
      carried to Babylon because she had rejected God's warnings through His
      prophets. Yet through divine love and mercy, another opportunity was granted
      her “to finish the transgression, to make an end of sins” (Daniel 9:24). Israel
      returned to her land and built a second temple.</p>

    <h2>The cry over Jerusalem</h2>
    <p><em>Near the end of our Messiah's earthly life, He beheld
        Jerusalem "and wept over it, saying, 'If you had known, even you, especially in
        this your day, the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from
        your eyes. <strong>For days will come upon you
          when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and close
          you in on every side, and level you, and your children within you, to the
          ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did
          not know the time of your visitation'</strong> "" (Luke 19:41-44,emphasis added).</em></p>

    <p><em>“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets, and
        stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children
        together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not
        willing! See! Your house is left to you desolate” (Matthew 23:37-38).</em></p>

    <p>During the week
      before His crucifixion, Jesus “went into the temple of God and drove out all
      those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money
      changers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, 'It is
      written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer," but you have made it a
      "den of thieves" ' " (Matthew 21:12-13). At this point, <strong>Jesus still called the second temple, 'My
        house.”
        But a change would
        come.</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>THIS TIME GOD
          WAS NOT SAYING: “YOU have FAILED. LET'S TRY AGAIN.” ISRAEL’S DECISION TO
          CRUCIFY CHRIST WOULD HAVE PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES. THE RESULT WOULD BE A SEARING
          SEPARATION—A PAINFUL, DIVINE DIVORCE.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Then “Jesus
      went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him
      the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, ‘Do you not see all these
      things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another,
      that shall not be thrown down' ” (Matthew 24:1-2). In A.D. 70, the second
      temple <strong>was destroyed by Romans and more
        than one million Jews perished. Such was the terrible results of that divine
        divorce</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The curse of the fig tree</h2>
    <p><em>“In the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry.
        And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves,
        and said to it, ‘Let no fruit grow on you ever again.’ Immediately the fig tree
        withered away” (verses 18-19).</em> Throughout the bible
      the fig tree was used a symbol of the Jewish nation.</p>

    <p><strong>The parable of the evil tenants and doom of Isreal</strong></p>
    <p>“When He came
      into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him
      as He was teaching” (verse 23). Jesus then told those leaders a parable that
      outlined the entire history of</p>

    <p>Israel in one
      panoramic sweep, culminating with their murderous designs</p>
    <p><em>There was a certain landowner </em><strong>[God]</strong> <em>who planted a
        vineyard </em><strong>[Israel] </strong><em>and set a
        hedge around it </em><strong>[God's love],</strong> <em>dug
        a winepress in it and built a <strong>tower </strong></em><strong>[the temple].</strong> <em>And he leased it
        to
        vinedressers </em><strong>[Israel's leaders]</strong> <em>and
        went into a far country. Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants</em><strong>[the prophets]
      </strong><em>to the vinedressers, that they might receive its
        fruit. And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned
        another. Again he sent other servants, more than the first</em><strong>[continued mercy],</strong><em>and
        they did likewise to them. Then <strong>last of all </strong></em><strong>[notice the word,“last”]</strong>
      <em>he sent his son to them </em><strong>[near the close of “seventy timesseven”],</strong>
      <em>saying, 'They will respect my son.'' But when the vinedressers saw the son,
        they said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize
        his inheritance.'' So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed
        him </em><strong>[their finalsin]”</strong>
      (Matthew 21:33-39, emphasis added).
    </p>

    <p>Jesus asked
      those leaders, “'therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he
      do to those vinedressers?'' They said to Him, 'He will destroy those wicked men
      miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him
      the fruits in their seasons' ” (verses 40-41).</p>

    <p><strong>Did they realize what they were saying? Hardly! They had
        pronounced their own doom.</strong></p>

    <h2>The parable of the wedding feast, the Jews and the Gentiles</h2>
    <p>In this
      parable, Jesus outlined the same historical sequence (as in the parable of the
      evil tenants) of the Jewish nation, but he added details of the destruction of
      Jerusalem and the call of the Gentiles</p>


    <p><em>The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king <strong>(God),</strong> who arranged a marriage
        <strong>(covenant relationship)</strong> for his son(<strong>Jesus),</strong> and sent out his
        servants(<strong>prophets)</strong> to call those who were
        invited to the wedding(Isreal); and they were not willing to come<strong>(first call before exile in Babylon
          by
          Nebuchadnezzar).</strong> Again, he sent out other servants, saying, “Tell those who
        are invited. 'See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are
        killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.'' But they made light of
        it and went their ways, one to his own farm, and another to his business. And
        the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them. But
        when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies,
        destroyed those murderers<strong> (Romans</strong>),
        and burned up their city (<strong>destruction of
          Jerusalem</strong>) </em>(Matthew 22:2-7, emphasis added).</p>
