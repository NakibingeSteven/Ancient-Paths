  <h1>Gog And Magog</h1>
  The
  Ezekiel 38 prophecy is applied by many to 1948 and to a final Middle East
  conflict between Russia and Israel. But the truth is truth is that the Book of
  Revelation chapter 20 actually applies Ezekiels prophecy to a global event
  predicted to occur at the end of the millennium.</p>

  <p><em>Now when the thousand years have expired, satan
      will be released from his prison <strong>and
        will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth,
        Gog and Magog</strong>, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the
      sand of the sea. They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the
      camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of
      heaven and devoured them.(</em> Revelation 20:7-9
    ,emphasis added)</p>

  <p>Both
    Ezekiel 38 and Revelation 20 speak about Gog, Magog, a great army, a final
    gathering for battle against Jerusalem, and fire from Heaven. Yet Revelation 20
    applies these things to the end of the millennium, to a global Gog and Magog,
    and to a final global battle against the saints and the beloved city, which is
    the New Jerusalem (see Revelation 3:12; 21:10; Hebrews 12:22). Thus Revelation
    20 takes what originally applied to Israel and applies it to a final global
    battle against the saints of Jesus Christ who are inside the New Jerusalem at the
    end of the millennium.</p>
