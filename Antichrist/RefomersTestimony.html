    <h1>Reformers Testimony</h1>
    <section>
      <p>The word <em>antichrist</em> literally means <strong>“opposed to”</strong> or <strong>“in the place of”</strong> Christ, and in its most subtle and diabolical manifestation, it concerns something which <em>claims loyalty to Jesus</em> while really leading away from Him.</p>
    
      <h3>Death of the church</h3>
      <p>In the fourth century, during the time of Constantine, a large portion of the church compromised key Bible truths and decided to line up with the Roman State. Rejecting the humility of the meek and lowly One (see Matthew 11:29), church leaders sought pomp and worldly glory. Leaving the heavenly “power of the Holy Spirit” (Romans 15:13), they relied on the earthly power of politics and government.</p>
    
      <p>In the twelfth century, a monstrous tribunal was established called the “Holy Office of the Inquisition” which was purposefully “created to persecute and exterminate ‘heresy’.</p>
    
      <p>By the time the 1500’s came along, the <strong>original simplicity of the early Christian faith</strong> was virtually nonexistent</h3>. All over Europe, sinners were taught to confess their sins to priests, to pray to the Virgin Mary, to buy “forgiveness notes” called indulgences, and to kiss statues of the saints, none of which is taught in the New Testament.</p>
    
      <h3>The rise of the reformers</h3>
      <p>There were sincere and godly people in what had become the Roman Catholic Church, but overall, Christianity was a mess! So God brought about a reformation of the now fallen apostate church. It was <em>sincere Catholics</em> wanting a change that originally spearheaded the Reformation. Initially, they had no thought of leaving the Mother Church but simply wanted to redirect their Catholic countrymen away from the traditions of men and to lead them back to the pure truths of the Word.</p>
    
      <h3>The Bible and the printing press</h3>
      <p>In the 1500’s, as a result of the invention of the printing press, countless European and English Catholics read the Bible for the first time in their lives. As a result, they uncovered the good news of salvation through trusting in Christ. At the same time, to their shock and amazement, they also realized that many Romish doctrines—including praying to dead saints and confessing to priests—actually led away from a simple faith in the merits of the Lamb.</p>
    
      <p>They began to question whether the Holy Apostolic Roman Catholic Church, as an institution centered on popes and the Vatican, was really the Bride of Jesus Christ in the first place.</p>
      <p>In amazement, they discovered what Paul actually wrote about “the falling away,” “the son of perdition,” and a “mystery of lawlessness” that would proudly set itself up inside “the temple of God,” which is the church (see 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4, 7; 1 Corinthians 3:16).</p>
    
      <h3>The testimony of Daniel</h3>
      <p>They discovered Daniel’s prophecy about a “little horn” with “eyes like the eyes of a man,” “a mouth speaking great things,” that would be centered in Western Europe and would make bloody “war against the saints” (Daniel 7:7-8, 21).</p>
    
      <p>They read about a harlot named “Mystery Babylon” who was “drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus” (Revelation 17:6).</p>
    
      <h3>MARTIN LUTHER (1483-1546) (LUTHERAN):</h3>
      <p><em>“Luther…proved, by the revelations of Daniel and St. John, by the epistles of St. Paul, St. Peter, and St. Jude, that the reign of Antichrist, predicted and described in the Bible, was the Papacy.”</em> J.H. Merle D’Aubigne, History of the Reformation of the Sixteen Century, Book 6, Chapter 12, (1846) (Reprinted by Hartland Publications, Rapidan, VA) 215.</p>
    
      <p>On August 20, 1520, Luther declared <em>“We here are of the conviction that the papacy is the seat of the true and real Antichrist.”</em> Quoted in Froom’s The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers, Vol. 2, 121.</p>
    
      <h3>JOHN CALVIN (1509-1564) (PRESBYTERIAN):</h3>
      <p><em>“Some persons think us too severe and censorious when we call the Roman pontiff Antichrist. But those who are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the same charge of presumption against Paul himself, after whom we speak and whose language we adopt…I shall briefly show that (Paul’s words in II Thess. 2) are not capable of any other interpretation than that which applies them to the Papacy.”</em> John Calvin, <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion,</em> Vol. 2 (Reinolde Wolfe & Richards Harison, London, England, 1561 edition) 410.</p>
    
      <h3>THOMAS CRANMER (1489-1556) (ANGLICAN):</h3>
      <p><em>“Whereof it followeth Rome to be the seat of antichrist, and the pope to be very antichrist himself. I could prove the same by many other scriptures, old writers, and strong reasons.”</em> [Unknown], <em>Works by Cranmer,</em> Vol. 1, pp. 6-7 n.p., n.d.</p>
    
      <h3>THE WESTMINSTER CONFESSION OF FAITH (1647):</h3>
      <p><em>“There is no other head of the church but the Lord Jesus Christ. Nor can the pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is that Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition that exalteth himself in the church against Christ and all that is called God.”</em> Philip Schaff, <em>the Creeds of Christendom, With a History and Critical Notes,</em> Chapter 25, Sec. 6 (New York, NY: Harper and Brothers, 1877) 658-659.</p>
    
      <h3>JOHN WESLEY (1703-1791) (METHODIST):</h3>
      <p><em>Speaking of the papacy, John Wesley wrote, “He is in an emphatic sense, the Man of Sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure. And he is, too, properly styled the Son of Perdition, as he has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers…</em></p>
    
      <p><em>He it is…that exalteth himself above all that is called</em></p>
      <p><em>God, or that is worshipped…claiming the highest power, and highest honor…claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone.”</em> John Wesley, Antichrist and His Ten Kingdoms 110 n.p., n.d.</p>
