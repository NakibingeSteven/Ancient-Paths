                <p>The scriptures portray not only a singular antichrist, but <em>multiple antichrists. </em>As stated
                    in 1 John 2:19, these numerous antichrists “<strong>went out from us,”</strong>
                    signifying their origin <em>from within the Christian community!</em></p>
                <p>This encompasses all that God's Word explicitly communicates about "antichrist," "antichrists,"
                    and "the spirit of antichrist." It's crucial to grasp that none of these insightful
                    passages direct us towards a single future malevolent leader.</p>
                <p><b>Confusions from other descriptions</b></p>
                <p>The Holy Scriptures unveil other prophecies concerning the rise of an evil "little horn" (Daniel
                    7:8),
                    a fearsome "beast" (Revelation 13:1), and "the man of sin" (2 Thessalonians 2:3). It is
                    predominantly these prophecies that are currently being interpreted to endorse the concept
                    of a future malevolent figure.</p>
                <p>The clear trajectory of <strong>the Bible's literal "antichrist" passages unequivocally points to
                        present realities that true Christians must confront and overcome</strong><em>. </em>So, why
                    would prophecies about the "little horn," "the man of sin," and "the beast" suddenly deviate from
                    this trend and pertain to circumstances Christians will <em>not encounter </em>as they will
                    first be taken away in the rapture?</p>

            <h2>Denying the nature of Christ</h2>
            <div class="card-container">

                <p>The Bible explicitly mentions on two occasions that rejecting the idea of “Jesus Christ coming in the
                    flesh” is a clear indication of antichrist.</p>

                <p><em>Any spirit acknowledging that Jesus Christ has taken human form is aligned with God, while a
                        spirit that denies this truth is not of God. This denial represents the spirit of the
                        Antichrist, a phenomenon already present in the world (1 John 4:2-3).</em></p>

                <p><em>Numerous deceivers have emerged globally, refusing to acknowledge Jesus Christ's manifestation in
                        human form. Such individuals are both deceivers and antichrists (2 John 7).</em></p>

                <p><strong>The Human Nature of Christ</strong></p>

                <p>When John mentions “Jesus Christ coming in the flesh,” he refers to the concept of “The Word becoming
                    flesh and dwelling among us” (John 1:14). Here, “The Word” denotes Jesus Christ before His birth in
                    Bethlehem, signifying the infinite Son of God taking on human form to live among humanity.</p>

                <p>In what manner did Jesus assume human form when He united with humanity?</p>

                <p>Paul answered with the utmost clarity: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
                    blood, He also Himself likewise took part of <em>the same</em>” (Hebrews 2:14 KJV, emphasis added).
                </p>

                <p>The term "children" doesn't pertain to Adam and Eve, as they were not infants but were directly
                    created by God in the Garden of Eden. Instead, it refers to their descendants after sin entered the
                    world, representing fallen humanity.</p>

                <p>How is the earthly nature of Jesus related to the concept of antichrist?</p>

                <p>The term "the flesh" is a biblical phrase referring to our fundamental human nature influenced by
                    sin. Jesus Christ voluntarily adopted this identical human nature to connect with us, comprehend our
                    challenges, undergo our temptations, and meet us where we stand.</p>

                <p>Despite Jesus embracing our flawed human nature and experiencing our humanity, He never engaged in
                    wrongdoing. He faced temptations in every aspect as we do, yet He remained without sin (Hebrews
                    4:15). Despite His genuine association with human flesh, Jesus, in His thoughts, emotions, and
                    character, maintained a state of holiness, harmlessness, purity, and separation from sinners
                    (Hebrews 7:26).</p>

                <p>By assuming our human nature without engaging in its sinful aspects, Jesus effectively denounced sin
                    within human existence (Romans 8:3). Furthermore, He sacrificed Himself for all our sins, those
                    instances where we succumbed to temptation (refer to 1 Corinthians 15:3).</p>

                <p><em>Therefore, in all things, He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and
                        faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God…For in that He Himself has suffered, being
                        tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted </em>(Hebrews 2:17-18)</p>

                <p><strong>Subtle Denial of the Nature of Christ</strong></p>

                <p>Does the Roman Church genuinely confess “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh”? On the surface, it
                    claims to do so, but let’s take a closer look. One of the official doctrines, or “confessions,” of
                    the Church of Rome is a dogma called The Immaculate Conception.</p>

                <p><strong>The Immaculate Conception</strong></p>

                <p>Contrary to what many think, this does not refer to the birth of Jesus as a sinless baby, but rather
                    to the conception of <strong>Mary herself inside her own mother’s womb.</strong> The dogma teaches
                    that when <strong>Mary was conceived, she was miraculously preserved from all original sin.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Thus, her nature was “immaculate,” or sinless, and therefore fundamentally <em>different </em>from
                    ours. In other words, according to papal teaching, Jesus’ mother did not have exactly the same flesh
                    and nature that we have.</p>

                <p><strong>Implications of the Immaculate Conception</strong></p>

                <p>According to papal Rome’s official statements, when Jesus Christ was born, He took <em>Mary’s
                        supposedly sinless nature, not ours. </em>If you think about it, this is really a denial that
                    “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” (1 John 4:3)!</p>

                <p>According to the Roman Church, when Jesus Christ was born, He took <em>Mary’s perfect nature, not our
                        fallen one.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Denying Jesus Came in the Flesh</strong></p>

                <p>This doctrine of The Immaculate Conception with its idea of the entrance of Jesus into Mary’s sinless
                    nature, not ours, really removes Christ “one gigantic step away from mankind.</p>

                <p><strong>Consequences of the Immaculate Conception</strong></p>

                <p>As a result of this dogma and others, Rome doesn’t teach sinners to “be direct” by going straight to
                    our heavenly Father through His Son Jesus Christ for free forgiveness.</p>

                <p>Rome declares that by virtue of Mary’s Immaculate Conception and supposedly sinless life, she now has
                    a “saving office” in addition to her Son. Through Mary’s “manifold intercession,” she is now our</p>

                <p>“Advocate, Helper, Benefactress, and Mediatrix” who can “bring us the gifts of eternal salvation” and
                    “deliver our souls from death<em> Catechism of the Catholic Church, </em>252.</p>

                <p>Thus, in her official teachings, in spite of appearances, the Roman Church really denies “Jesus
                    Christ has come in <em>the flesh</em>” (1 John 4:3, emphasis added), that is, in <em>“the same”
                    </em>(Hebrews 2:14, emphasis added) fallen flesh the rest of us have.</p>

                <p><strong>Denying Jesus' Nature in Paul’s Time</strong></p>

                <p>According to the Bible, “the spirit of the Antichrist” was “already” working in John’s own day
                    (church history records a group called Gnostics who denied Jesus Christ’s coming in the flesh in the
                    first century). As history progressed, the same spirit later reared its head through the Immaculate
                    Conception idea.</p>

            <h2>Not a Man(The Antichrist System)</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>Definition</p>
                <blockquote>
                    While the Greek prefix 'anti' generally means 'against' or 'opposed to,' it can also mean 'in the
                    place of' or 'a substitute for.' The Antichrist will embody both meanings. He will oppose Christ
                    while pretending to be Christ. Instead of a frontal assault against Christianity, the evil one will
                    pervert the church from within by posing as its founder. He will cunningly misrepresent Christ while
                    pretending to be Christ. And right here is where the plot thickens. If the Antichrist will indeed
                    pretend to be the Christ, then his followers must be 'Christians!'
                    <footer>Dave Hunt, Global Peace, p. 7-8.</footer>
                </blockquote>

                <p>So the Antichrist will not be an atheistic and blasphemous individual openly attacking Christianity
                    but rather a system that claims to act in the place of and in the name of Christ.</p>

                <p><b>System not man described by John</b></p>
                <p>John wrote about "many antichrists" (1 John 2:18), and "that spirit of antichrist" (1 John 4:3 KJV).
                    He also revealed that anyone who denies "the doctrine of Christ" (2 John 9) is "a deceiver and an
                    antichrist" (2 John 7, emphasis added).</p>

                <p>Therefore, the idea of only one person as the Antichrist fails the biblical test.</p>

                <p><strong>Paul’s Singular Descriptions and their pluralistic interepretation</strong></p>
                <p>Paul used various phrases in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 to describe the Antichrist, such as “the son
                    of perdition” (vs. 3), “the mystery of lawlessness” (vs. 7), and “that Wicked” (vs. 8 KJV) but a
                    careful study of 2 Thessalonians 2 reveals the impossibility of “the man of sin” applying to only
                    one person. Paul stated that in his own day, this “mystery of lawlessness [was] already at work”
                    (vs. 7).</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Time of action: </b>This predicted Antichrist was already active in the first century, and
                        Paul emphasized that this
                        “mystery” would continue until the second coming of Jesus Christ (vs. 8). How could this refer
                        to only one human being? He would have to be 2,000 years old.</li>
                    <li><b>Corporate use of man: </b>Paul used the expression “the man” in 2 Timothy 3:16-17 in a way
                        that does not refer to one
                        individual but to a succession of godly men throughout history who become “complete” through
                        obeying the Word of God.</li>
                    <li>In Romans 13:4 (KJV), Paul also used the phrase “the minister of God” to refer to all civil
                        officers throughout history whom God uses to restrain evil.</li>
                    <li>According to Paul’s own writings, “the man of sin” (2 Thessalonians 2:3) may properly apply to a
                        historical succession of individuals who follow tradition above the Word of Truth.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Daniel and the kingdom/King interpreations of horns and beasts</strong></p>
                <p>In Daniel’s parallel prophecy, this same abominable horror is called a little “horn” (Daniel 7:8),
                    and in the Book of Revelation, it is labeled “the beast” (Revelation 13:2). The question arises: Do
                    these apply to only one “Evil Dude” or do they point to something wider and deeper?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A Beast:</strong> An angelic interpreter explained to Daniel, “…the fourth beast shall
                        be a
                        fourth kingdom on earth” (vs. 23). The beast represents a kingdom; hence, the Antichrist, who is
                        a
                        beast, must be a collection of people, not an individual.</li>

                    <li><strong>A Horn:</strong> The ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another
                        king
                        will appear, overthrowing three kings (Dan 7:24 GNB). The horns represent ten kings connected
                        with
                        their kingdoms, pointing to a list of kings since men rarely outlive their kingdoms.</li>
                </ol>


                <p>So the little horn represents groups of men, antichrists throughout history who oppose God.</p>

                <p>In summary, the Antichrist is a system, not a man because:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Conservative Bible scholars agree that the <strong>man of sin</strong> (2 Thessalonians 2), the
                        <strong>little horn</strong> (Daniel 7), and <strong>the beast</strong> (Revelation 13:1-10) all
                        represent <strong>the same power</strong>. In prophecy, a <strong>beast always represents a
                            kingdom</strong>, not an individual person.
                    </li>
                    <li>The little horn would rule for a period of <strong>1260 years</strong>; no individual has lived
                        that long!</li>
                    <li>The man of sin was underground in the days of the apostle Paul and was being restrained.
                        According to 2 Thessalonians 2:8-9, the same man of sin will be destroyed by the brightness of
                        Christ’s coming. There is not a person on planet earth who was alive in the days of Paul and
                        will still be alive when Jesus comes.</li>
                    <li>The expression ‘the man of sin’ would seem to refer to an individual. However, the use of a
                        singular word in plurality appears in other contexts for a succession of persons and not for
                        lone individuals. In <strong>1 Samuel 8:11</strong>, the expression ‘<strong>the king</strong>’
                        is used of a succession of kings. Finally, <strong>2 Timothy 3:17</strong> uses the expression
                        ‘<strong>the man of God’</strong> to describe all Christians of all times.</li>

                <p>The Bible's prophecies about the antichrist are similar to a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. While

                <p><strong>The final puzzle has a message like this</strong></p>
                <p>The antichrist
                    that was started to work in the time of Paul, but was being restrained by the
                    Roman Empire. It would grow in strength in the wake of a massive “falling away”
                    from Jesus inside the Christian Church and would be “revealed” unrestrained
                    after the Roman Empire fell in 476 A.D. It would be centered somewhere in
                    Western Europe, would become self-exalting, and would even usurp the authority
                    of God inside His temple—that is, within Christianity. An actual “kingdom,” it
                    would nevertheless have “eyes like the eyes of a man” (being man-led and
                    man-centered), make large claims for itself, have “a mouth speaking great
                    things,” become persecuting and deadly, making “war against the saints.” It
                    would continue throughout Christian history and achieve global influence in the
                    end times, yet finally be destroyed by the sin-consuming brightness of our Lord
                    Jesus Christ when He returns.</p>
