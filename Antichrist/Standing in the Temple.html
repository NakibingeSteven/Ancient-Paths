  <h1>Antichrist in the Temple(Physical or Spiritual Tmeples)</h1>
  <h2>What is the temple the antichrist stands in?</h2>
  <p>Modern prophecy teachers claim that the antichrist, enters the temple in Jerusalem and declares himself God,
    leading the world to the brink of Armageddon and The cornerstone Bible passage
    underlying this idea is 2 Thessalonians 2:4.</p>

  <p></p>Describing the antichrist, Paul wrote: </p><br>
  <em>“…[he]
    opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped,
    so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God”
    (vs. 4).</em></p>
  <p>Thus antichrist will sit “in the
    temple of God.” The implication of this common interpretation is that Paul's
    antichrist-in-the-temple prediction has nothing to do with Christians today,
    nor has it had any real relevance to the Church for almost 2,000 years. Is this
    popular interpretation <em>really </em>what Paul had in mind?</p>

  <p>Note: here Paul is definitely refering to Daniel 11.</p>

  <p><b>Jewish temples nullified by Christ</b></p>
  <p>Jesus Christ died on Calvary,
    His death put an end to all bloody animal sacrifices. When He cried out, “It is
    finished!” (John 19:30), that was it. From God's perspective, all earthly
    sacrifices were over because His Son was the final Sacrifice, type had met
    antitype (see Hebrews 10:12).</p>

  <p>If the Jewish people ever do
    rebuild a temple in Jerusalem and restart bloody sacrifices, this would be a <em>complete denial of Jesus
      Christ's sacrifice</em>.
    Could such a rebuilt Jewish temple ever properly be called by Paul, “the temple
    <em>of God</em>”?
  </p>

  <p><strong>The
      church as a temple</strong></p>
  <p>When the apostle Paul used the
    word 'temple' (<strong>naos),</strong> he always
    applied it spiritually to the <strong>Christian
      church</strong> and <strong>never to the literal
      Jewish temple</strong> (1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; 6:19, 20; 2 Corinthians 6:16;
    Ephesians 2:21).</p>

  <p>Let's allow Paul to interpret
    Paul. In his letter to the early Corinthians, Paul wrote to “the church of God
    which is at Corinth” (1 Corinthians 1:2)
    Then he inquired,</p>

  <p><em>“Do you not know that you are the temple[naos]
    </em></p>

  <p> of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16)</p>
  <p>Here Paul clearly applied the
    word <em>naos </em>to the Christian Church/He did the same thing in his letter to
    the Ephesians Writing to “the saints who are in Ephesus,” Paul said they were
    all growing “into a holy temple [naos] in the Lord” (Ephesians 1:1; 2:21). </p>

  <p><em>“Now,
      therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with
      the saints and members of the household of God, <strong>20 </strong>having been built on
      the foundation of the <strong>apostles and prophets</strong>, Jesus Christ Himself being
      the <strong>chief cornerstone</strong>, <strong>21 </strong>in whom the <strong>whole building</strong>,
      being fitted together, grows into a <strong>holy temple </strong>in the Lord, <strong>22 </strong>in
      whom you also <strong>are being built </strong>together for a <strong>dwelling place of God </strong>in
      the Spirit.”</em><strong> (Ephesians 2:19-22)</strong></p>

  <p>In conclusion, the man of sin
    who sits in the temple of God must <strong>sit within the Christian Church</strong>. The
    link between the <strong>little horn </strong>and the <strong>man of sin </strong>can be clearly
    seen by the fact that the little horn/beast speaks <strong>blasphemies </strong>against
    the Most High and <strong>demands worship because he is the church of God and so
      tire to also claim the titles of God hence blaspheme</strong></p>

  <p><strong>In
      summary</strong></p>
  <p>The correct interpretation of 2
    Thessalonians 2:4, based on Paul's own use of <em>naos, </em>is that “the temple
    of God” <em>is the Church. </em>The lesson for prophecy students is this:
    Antichrist, subtle and deceptive, <strong><em>will
        enter into Christinity</em></strong></p>

  <p><strong><em>Testimony </em></strong></p>
  <p><em>Observe
      the place occupied by the man
      of sin—the “temple” or house of God. This is not, and cannot be, any Jewish
      temple. Paul, who uses this expression in his prophetic portrait…employs it
      both in Corinthians and Ephesians with reference to the Christian Church…To Paul
      emphatically the temple of God was the Church of Christ. This is the temple in which his
      prophetic eye saw the man of sin seated.</em></p>

  <p><em>It
      is no question of his bodily location in any structure of wood and stone, but
      of something far higher. The temple of God is that “spiritual house” in which
      He dwells. It is built up of “living stones,” of true believers. It is here
      that the man of sin was to usurp the place of God. This is the “mystery,” the
      dread danger, the deadly evil, predicted by the Apostle.</em>
