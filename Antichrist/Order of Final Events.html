  <h1>Order of final Events</h1>
  <section>
    <p>The question
      is: What did Paul teach about the sequence of events? Did he say the Church
      would be gathered to Jesus Christ <em>before </em>the antichrist comes, or will
      antichrist come <em>first, </em>before we are gathered to the Savior?</p>

    <p>Paul wrote:</p>
    <p><em>Now, brethren, concerning the coming(parousia=second coming)
        of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, not to
        be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter,
        as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. Let no one deceive you by
        any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes <strong>first</strong>,
        and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition </em>(2 Thessalonians 2:1-3, emphasis added).</p>

    <p>Paul's words are quite
      penetrating when it comes to the issue of which comes first, “our gathering” or
      the appearance of antichrist.</p>

    <p>To those early
      Thessalonian believers, Paul's message was that “the day of Christ” was not
      just around the corner. Something big must happen first. And to us who live in
      the 21st century, Paul's message is equally clear: Before Jesus Christ comes to
      “gather” us, “the falling away comes first” and the antichrist must be
      revealed. Paul directly, specifically, and earnestly warned the Church <em>not
        to be deceived </em>about this very thing! Evidently he knew Satan would work
      hard to dupe the saints in this exact area.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary
        of 2Th 2:1-3 KJV</strong></p>
    <p>Verse 1: Paul wrote about “the
      coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him.” This is
      obviously the same event as the descent of Jesus Christ from Heaven and our
      being “caught up together” to meet Him in the air(1 Thessalonians 4:17). It's
      important to realize that the Greek word for “coming” in verse 1 is none other
      than our old friend “Parousia,” which we have seen clearly applies to the
      visible second coming of Jesus Christ (see Matthew 24:27). The exact same word
      is used in verse 8 describing “the brightness of His coming [Parousia].”</p>

    <p>Verse 2: Here Paul addressed a
      distortion about the timing of the coming of the Lord that was confusing the
      early Church. He urged the Thessalonians not to be “soon shaken,” or
      “troubled,” by false influences which were teaching, either by “word,” or “spirit,”
      or “letter,” that “the day of Christ had [already] come,” or, as the King James
      Version puts it, was “at hand” in the first century. Because of this false
      teaching that “the day of Christ” was just around the corner in their own day,
      some of the Thessalonian Christians had quit their jobs, stopped providing for
      their families, and were just hanging around in idle expectancy waiting for
      Christ's imminent appearance (see 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12).</p>

    <p>Verse 3: Paul clarified the
      truth with this warning, “Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day
      [when Jesus comes to gather us—verse 1]
    </p>
    <p> will not come unless the falling away
      comes first, and that man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition.”</p>

    <p><strong>THE FALLING
        AWAY FIRST</strong></p>
    <p>In the first century, the Christian church remained
      relatively pure from heresy, false doctrine, and open sin. A brief survey of
      the following Bible passages shows plainly that an apostasy, departure, or
      “falling away” from Jesus Christ was predicted to occur inside of Christianity</p>

            Paul told “the elders of the church” of
            Ephesus (vs. 17) that soon many false Christian leaders would rise up from
            among themselves to “draw away the disciples” after them (vs. 30).
            He was so burdened about this coming
            apostasy that he warned the church “night and day with tears” (vs. 31).

            themselves teachers;
            and they will turn their ears away from
            the truth, and be turned aside to fables” (verses 3-4)

            fallen; repent and do the first works…” (Verses 4 and 5).
