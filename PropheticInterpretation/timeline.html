  <h1>Muddying the Prophecy Waters</h1>
  <p>In
    our 21st century, historicism has faded and futurism is in as the majority
    report. What happened? How did the seismic shift take place? The story is both
    fascinating and tragic. Here are the highlights</p>

        <h2>Counter Reformation</h2>
        <p>At the Council of Trent the Roman
          Church reacted against the Reformation by commissioning members of the Jesuit
          Order to counteract historicism</p>

        <h2>Two Jesuit Alterantives</h2>
        <p>Alcasar and Ribera put forth their
          anti-Protestant counter-theories. Francisco Ribera master-minded a virus, the
          virus of futurism. For the next 300 years his Jesuit cohorts did their best to
          insert this virus into Protestant churches, especially through educational
          processes connected with the universities of Europe, but they failed</p>

        <h2>Dr. Samuel Roffey Maitland (1792-1866)</h2>
        <p>He was a British lawyer and Bible scholar, became a librarian to the
          Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth. It is likely that one day he discovered
          Ribera's commentary in the library. In any event, in 1826 he published a widely
          read book attacking the Reformation and supporting the Jesuit idea of a future
          Mr. Antichrist person. For the next ten years, in tract after tract, he
          continued his anti-Reformation rhetoric

        <h2>John Henry Newman (1801-1890)</h2>
        <p>He was a member of the Church of England and a leader of the famous Oxford movement
          (1833- 1845). In 1850, Newman wrote his “Letter on Anglican Difficulties”
          blatantly revealing that one of the goals of the movement was to lead “the
          various English denominations and parties” back to Rome. The “Oxford Tracts” gave
          fresh weight to “anti-Protestant opinions,” gave “assistance [to] the laborers
          of the futurist school,” worked to “unprotestantize the Church of England” and
          “set aside all application to the Roman Papacy of the fearful prophecies
          respecting Antichrist.</p>
        <p>After publishing his own pamphlet about a future Mr. Sinister, Newman himself became
          a Catholic, and later a highly honored cardinal. Through the combined
          influences of Maitland, Todd, Burgh, Newman, and others, a definite “Rome ward

        <h2>Edward Irving (1792- 1834)</h2>
        <p>The Scottish Presbyterian minister Edward Irving (1792- 1834) who pastored the
          large Chalcedonian Chapel in London with over 1,000 members. Cofounder of The
          Society for the Investigation of Prophecy, Irving eventually accepted the
          one-man antichrist idea of Newman, Burgh, Todd, Maitland, Bellarmine, and
          Ribera, yet he went a step further. Somewhere around 1830, Edward Irving began
          to teach the novel idea of a two-phase return of Christ, the first phase being <em>a secret rapture
            before the rise</em> <em>of antichrist.(</em> <em>Dave MacPherson, The Incredible Cover-Up: Exposing the
            Origins of Rapture Theories (Medford,OR: Omega Publications,1980) 30-32.)</em></p>

        <h2>John Nelson Darby (1800-1882).</h2>
        <p>A
          brilliant lawyer, pastor, and theologian, Darby wrote more than 53 books on
          Bible subject. On the positive side, he staunchly defended the infallibility of
          the Scriptures against British liberalism, and soon became one of the leaders
          of an English group called the Plymouth Brethren. Darby's contribution to the
          development of evangelical theology has been so great he has been called, The
          Father of Modern Dispensationalism. He became a champion for the
          pre-tribulation rapture idea. Darby visited America six times from 1859 to
          1874, preaching in all its major cities. </p>

        <h2>Cyrus Ingerson Scofield(1843-1921)</h2>
        <p>A Kansas lawyer who was greatly influenced by the writings of
          Darby. In 1909, Scofield published the first edition of his famous Scofield
          Reference Bible. In the early 1900's, this Bible became so popular in American
          Protestant Bible schools that literally millions of copies were printed. What
          made Scofield's Bible so energizing was not so much the Scripture itself, but
          his footnotes.</p>

        <p>In the 1970's, Pastor Hal Lindsey,
          a graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, released his blockbuster book, <em>The Late Great
            Planet Earth. </em>This 177-page, easy-to-read volume brought futurism to the

        <h2>The Left Behind Books</h2>
        <p>In the 1990's, Tim LaHaye and
          Jerry B. Jenkins took the future Mr. Evil idea of Hal Lindsey, Scofield, Darby,
          Irving, Newman, Todd, Maitland, and the Jesuit Ribera. Lindsey's book, The Late Great Planet
          Earth, was
          largely
          theological, while Left Behind is a fast-moving sequence of highly imaginative
          novels “overflowing with suspense, action, and adventure,” a “Christian
          thriller,” with a “label its creators could never have predicted: blockbuster
          success”</p>
