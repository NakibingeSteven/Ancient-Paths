  <h1>Summary of the Path of teh Confusion</h1>
  <p><strong>Guinness and Elliott's classic summaries of the “Battle
      of the Isms” that still rages in our 21st-century</strong></p>

  <p><em>[The] futurist system of interpreting the prophecies is
      now held, strange to say, by many Protestants, but it was first invented by the
      Jesuit Ribera, at the end of the sixteenth century, to relieve the papacy from
      the terrible stigma cast upon it by the Protestant interpretation. This
      interpretation was so evidently the true and intended one that the adherents of
      the Papacy felt its edge must, at any cost, be turned or blunted. If the Papacy
      were the predicted antichrist, as Protestants asserted, then there was an end
      to the question, and separation from it was an imperative duty.</em></p>
  <p><em>There were only two alternatives. If the antichrist
      were not a present power, he must either be a past or a future one. Some
      writers asserted that the predictions pointed back to Nero. This did not take
      into account the obvious fact that the antichristian power predicted was to
      succeed the fall of the Caesars, and develop among the Gothic nations. The
      other alternative became therefore the popular one with the Papists. </em>
    <em>Antichrist was future, </em><em>so Ribera and
      Bossuet and others taught. An individual man was intended, not a dynasty; the
      duration of his power would not be for twelve and a half centuries, but only
      three and a half years; he would be an open foe of Christ, not a false friend;
      he would…sit in the Jewish temple. Speculation about the future took place of
      study of the past and present, and careful comparison of the facts of history
      with the predictions of prophecy. This related, so it was asserted, not to the
      main course of the history of the Church, but only to the few closing years of
      her history. The Papal head of the Church of Rome was not the power delineated
      by Daniel and St. John. Accurately as it answered to the description, it was
      not the criminal indicated. It must be allowed to go free, and the detective
      must look out for another man, who was sure to turn up by and by…</em>
  </p>
  <p><em>It is held by many that the </em><em>historic </em><em>school of interpretation is represented only by
    </em><em>a small modern section of the</em><em> </em><em>Church. </em><em>We shall show that </em><em>it has
      existed from the beginning,</em><em> and includes the </em><em>larger part </em><em>of the greatest and
      best teachers of the church for
      1800 years. We shall show that the </em><em>Fathers</em><em> of the Church
      belonged to it, that the </em><em>confessors,
      reformers, </em><em>and </em><em>martyrs
    </em><em>belonged to it, and that it included a vast multitude</em><em> </em><em>of erudite expositors of
      later times. </em></p>

  <p><em>We shall show that</em><em> </em><em>all these have held to the </em>
    <em>central truth </em><em>that prophecy </em><em>faithfully mirrors the Church's history as a whole, and
      not
      merely a commencing or closing fragment of that history…</em>
  </p>
  <p><em>We shall show that </em><em>the futurist school of interpretation, on the
      contrary, is chiefly represented by teachers belonging to the Church of Rome;
      that the Popes, cardinals, bishops, and priests of that apostate Church are all
      futurists, </em><em>and that the futurist interpretation is one of the chief
      pillars of Romanism…</em><em></em></p>

  <p><em>Is this the position you adopt? Is this the conclusion
      you defend? Are these the views you advocate? You, a Protestant, and this after
      all that has been written upon the subject, and all the blaze of light which
      history and experience have poured upon it? If it is, </em><em>look that you be not found</em><em>
    </em><em>fighting against the truth, </em><em>warring against the
      Word of God, resisting the testimony of the prophetic Spirit; hindering the
      work of the Reformation, promoting the progress of the apostasy, opposing
      Christ, and helping antichris</em>t<em> H. Grattan Guinness, Romanism and the
      Reformation, 99-101,141.</em></p>


  <p><strong>Now the words of Elliott:</strong></p>
  <p><em>In conclusion, the readers of this Historic Sketch will
      see that there are but </em><em>three
      grand Schemes of Apocalyptic</em><em> </em><em>Interpretation
    </em><em>that can be considered as standing up face to face against each other…The 1st is that of
      the </em><em>Praeterists;</em><em> respecting the
      subject of prophecy, except in its two or three</em></p>
  <p><em>last chapters [of Revelation], to the catastrophes of
      the Jewish nation and old Roman Empire…which Scheme, originally propounded, as
      we saw, by the Jesuit Alcasar, and then adopted by Grotius…by Professor Moses
      Stuart in the United States of America, and by disciples in the German School
      in England…</em></p>

  <p><em>The 2nd is the </em><em>Futurist Scheme; </em><em>making the whole of the Apocalyptic Prophecy,
      (accepting
      perhaps the primary Vision and the Letters to the Seven Churches,) to relate to
      things now future, viz. the things concerning Christ's second Advent: a Scheme
      first set forth, [as] we saw, by the Jesuit</em></p>
  <p><em>Ribera, at the end of the 16th century; and which in
      its main principle has been urged alike by Dr. S.R. Maitland, Mr. Burgh, and
      the Oxford Tractator on Antichrist [John Henry Newman], and others, in our own
      times and era, not without considerable success…</em></p>

  <p><em>The 3rd is what we may call emphatically the </em><em>Protestant continuous Historic Scheme of
      Interpretation; </em><em>that which</em><em>
    </em><em>regards
      the Apocalypse as a pre-figuration in detail of the</em><em> </em><em>chief events affecting the Church
      and Christendom,</em><em> </em><em>whether secular or ecclesiastical, from St. John's time to
      the</em><em> </em><em>consummation:—a
      Scheme which, in regard of its particular</em><em> </em><em>application of the symbols of Babylon and
      the Beast to Papal</em><em> </em><em>Rome and Popedom, was early embraced, as we saw, by the</em><em>
    </em><em>Waldenses, Wickliffites, and Hussites; then adopted with</em><em> </em><em>fuller light by the
      chief reformers, German, Swiss, French</em><em> </em><em>and English, of the 16th century; and
      transmitted downwards uninterruptedly,
      even to the present time.</em></p>

  <p>It is the last of
    which [historicism] I embrace for my own part with a full and ever
    strengthening conviction of its truth</em>.<em> Elliot Horae, Vol.4, 562, 563.</em></p>
