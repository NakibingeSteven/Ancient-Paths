            <h2>Three Roads</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <p>Three important isms—preterism, futurism, and historicism reflect three competing schools of
                    prophetic interpretation beneath all the varying interpretations</p>

                <p><strong>The Counter Reformation</strong></p>
                <p>Papal Rome rose
                    to its own defense in what became known as the Counter Reformation. In 1545,
                    she convened a special council destined to become the heart of her central
                    intelligence operation against Martin Luther and the Protestants.</p>

                <p>This famous
                    council took place in northern Italy in the city of Trent, and is now known as
                    the Council of Trent. its many sessions
                    continued until 1563.</p>

                <p>A new tactic
                    was needed to counteract the reformers , something less obvious. <em>This is
                        where the Jesuits came in.</em> On August 15, 1534, Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556)
                    founded the Society of Jesus, otherwise known as the Jesuits.</p>

                <p>This highly
                    secretive and militant Catholic order has a dark history of intrigue and
                    sedition; that's why its members were expelled from Portugal (1759), France
                    (1764), Spain (1767), Naples (1767), and Russia (1820</p>

                <p><strong>Hiding the beast</strong></p>
                <p>Two very
                    intelligent Spanish Jesuits rose to the challenge, Luis de Alcasar (1554-1613)
                    of Seville and Francisco Ribera (1537-1591) of Salamanca. Their strategy was,
                    in a nutshell, one of reapplication and diversion, yet they went in opposite
                    directions</p>

                <p>Alcasar decided
                    to apply the Bible's antichrist prophecies to the <em>ancient past </em>while
                    Ribera applied them to the <em>distant future</em>. By reapplying these
                    prophecies to the past and to the future instead of to the <em>present, </em>these
                    two tricky Jesuit scholars sought to divert the prophetic finger light-years
                    away from the Vatican.</p>

                <p>Even the
                    Catholic writer, G.S. Hitchcock, confirmed the origin of these anti-Protestant
                    counter-theories:</p>

                <p><em>The Futurist School, founded by the Jesuit Ribera in 1591,
                        looks for Antichrist, Babylon, and a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem, at the end of
                        the Christian Dispensation.</em></p>

                <p><em>The Praeterist School, founded by the Jesuit Alcasar in 1614,
                        explains Revelation by the Fall of Jerusalem or by the fall of Pagan Rome in
                        410 A.D</em> G. S. Hitchcock, The Beasts and the Little Horn 7; Quoted by Froom, Vol.2, 488.</p>

                <p><strong>PRETERISM</strong></p>
                <p>Developed in
                    the 1600's by the Jesuit Alcasar into a full anti-Protestant system, preterism
                    strategically removes the “little horn!” stigma away from the Vatican. Jesuit
                    objective achieved. Preterism sees the majority (or all) of the prophecies
                    found in Matthew 24 and the Book of</p>

                <p>Revelation as
                    having already been fulfilled in either the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. or in
                    the fall or Rome. For preterists, “the end of the world” usually means “the end
                    of the Jewish world.”</p>

                <p>Full-preterists
                    believe even the second coming of Jesus Christ somehow mystically occurred in
                    70 A.D., whereas partial-preterists still believe in a future, literal return
                    of the Savior. Preterists usually see the Roman Emperor Nero as the number-one
                    candidate for antichrist</p>
                <p>Preterism has
                    always been a minority viewpoint within the church</p>

                <p><strong>FUTURISM</strong></p>
                <p>Futurism
                    usually sees the majority of Revelation's prophecies (from chapter 4 onward) as
                    yet on the horizon. Concerning the antichrist, instead of preterism application
                    to Nero in the past, futurism generally applies the prophecies of “the little
                    horn,” “the man of sin,” and “the beast” to a single, yet-future evil world
                    ruler.</p>

                <p>Compared to
                    preterism and historicism, futurism has by far the most adherents in the 21st
                    century as the majority report.</p>

                <p>Futurism also
                    stops the clock between the 69th and 70th weeks of Daniel 9:24-27.this
                    parenthesis theory teaches that when Jerusalem or Rome fell, prophecy stopped,
                    only to continue again near the time of the rapture. This skips 1,500 years of
                    living prophetic history under the proverbial rug by inserting this infamous
                    gap into the visions of Daniel and Revelation</p>

                <p><strong>HISTORICISM</strong></p>
                <p>Historicism teaches
                    straight-forward, chronological progression by saying that the major prophecies
                    of Daniel and Revelation find fulfillment <em>throughout</em> <em>Christian
                        history while pointing toward the climactic, visible</em> <em>second coming of
                        our Savior</em>. Historicism also places special emphasis on the ongoing
                    struggle between Jesus Christ and Satan <em>inside </em>the Christian church</p>

                <p>Historicism also recognizes that there were
                    indeed prophecies fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem (thus preterists
                    aren't all wrong), yet it also stands for the reality of future events such as
                    the mark of the beast (see Revelation 14:9-12), the seven last plagues (see
                    Revelation 16), the battle of Armageddon (see Revelation 16:16), the return of
                    Jesus Christ (see Revelation 14:14-16), a 1000-year period (see Revelation 20),
                    the final judgment (see Revelation 20:11-13), the lake of fire (see Revelation
                    20:15) and the new earth (see Revelation 21:1). Thus futurists have some truth
                    also</p>
